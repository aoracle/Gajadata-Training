INTRODUCTORY	1
NOTE	1
By	1
Professor	1
J.	1
Arthur	1
Thomson	1
Was	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
great	1
philosopher	1
and	1
mathematician	1
Leibnitz	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
knowledge	1
advances	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
becomes	1
possible	1
to	1
condense	1
it	1
into	1
little	1
books?	1
Now	1
this	1
"Outline	1
of	1
Science"	1
is	1
certainly	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
book,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
illustrates	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
Leibnitz's	1
wise	1
saying.	1
For	1
here	1
within	1
reasonable	1
compass	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
library	1
of	1
little	1
books--an	1
outline	1
of	1
many	1
sciences.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
profitable	1
to	1
the	1
student	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
discrimination	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
used.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
Encyclopæa,	1
giving	1
condensed	1
and	1
comprehensive	1
articles	1
with	1
a	1
big	1
full	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
"primers,"	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
each	1
subject	1
and	1
working	1
methodically	1
onwards.	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
idea.	1
What	1
then	1
is	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
this	1
book?	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
intelligent	1
student-citizen,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
"the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
street,"	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
intellectual	1
keys	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
open	1
doors	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
hitherto	1
shut	1
to	1
him,	1
partly	1
because	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
treasures	1
behind	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
the	1
portals	1
were	1
made	1
forbidding	1
by	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
display	1
of	1
technicalities.	1
Laying	1
aside	1
conventional	1
modes	1
of	1
treatment	1
and	1
seeking	1
rather	1
to	1
open	1
up	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
one	1
might	1
on	1
a	1
walk	1
with	1
a	1
friend,	1
the	1
work	1
offers	1
the	1
student	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
informal	1
introductions	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
departments	1
of	1
knowledge.	1
To	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
another	1
way,	1
the	1
articles	1
are	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
clues	1
which	1
the	1
reader	1
may	1
follow	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
his	1
starting	1
point	1
very	1
far	1
behind.	1
Perhaps	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
far	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
ungrateful	1
to	1
the	1
simple	1
book	1
of	1
"instructions	1
to	1
travellers"	1
which	1
this	1
"Outline	1
of	1
Science"	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
be.	1
The	1
simple	1
"bibliographies"	1
appended	1
to	1
the	1
various	1
articles	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
indicate	1
"first	1
books."	1
Each	1
article	1
is	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
an	1
intellectual	1
adventure,	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
lists	1
of	1
books	1
are	1
merely	1
finger-posts	1
for	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
journey.	1
We	1
confess	1
to	1
being	1
greatly	1
encouraged	1
by	1
the	1
reception	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
serial	1
issue	1
of	1
"The	1
Outline	1
of	1
Science."	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
hearty--we	1
might	1
almost	1
say	1
enthusiastic.	1
For	1
we	1
agree	1
with	1
Professor	1
John	1
Dewey,	1
that	1
"the	1
future	1
of	1
our	1
civilisation	1
depends	1
upon	1
the	1
widening	1
spread	1
and	1
deepening	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
habit	1
of	1
mind."	1
And	1
we	1
hope	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
"The	1
Outline	1
of	1
Science"	1
makes	1
for.	1
Information	1
is	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
good;	1
interesting	1
information	1
is	1
better	1
still;	1
but	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
habit	1
of	1
mind.	1
Another	1
modern	1
philosopher,	1
Professor	1
L.	1
T.	1
Hobhouse,	1
has	1
declared	1
that	1
the	1
evolutionist's	1
mundane	1
goal	1
is	1
"the	1
mastery	1
by	1
the	1
human	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
conditions,	1
internal	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
external,	1
of	1
its	1
life	1
and	1
growth."	1
Under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
this	1
conviction	1
"The	1
Outline	1
of	1
Science"	1
has	1
been	1
written.	1
For	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
science,	1
but	1
science	1
for	1
life.	1
And	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
science,	1
to	1
our	1
way	1
of	1
thinking,	1
is	1
the	1
individual	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
things.	1
Science	1
is	1
our	1
legacy;	1
we	1
must	1
use	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
very	1
own.	1

The	1
Outline	1
of	1
Science	1
INTRODUCTION	1
There	1
is	1
abundant	1
evidence	1
of	1
a	1
widened	1
and	1
deepened	1
interest	1
in	1
modern	1
science.	1
How	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise	1
when	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
magnitude	1
and	1
the	1
eventfulness	1
of	1
recent	1
advances?	1
But	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
would	1
be	1
even	1
greater	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
if	1
the	1
makers	1
of	1
new	1
knowledge	1
were	1
more	1
willing	1
to	1
expound	1
their	1
discoveries	1
in	1
ways	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
"understanded	1
of	1
the	1
people."	1
No	1
one	1
objects	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
technicalities	1
in	1
a	1
game	1
or	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
yacht,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
clearly	1
necessary	1
for	1
terse	1
and	1
precise	1
scientific	1
description.	1
It	1
is	1
certain,	1
however,	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
minimum	1
without	1
sacrificing	1
accuracy,	1
when	1
the	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
is	1
to	1
explain	1
"the	1
gist	1
of	1
the	1
matter."	1
So	1
this	1
OUTLINE	1
OF	1
SCIENCE	1
is	1
meant	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
reader,	1
who	1
lacks	1
both	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
for	1
special	1
study,	1
and	1
yet	1
would	1
take	1
an	1
intelligent	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
science	1
which	1
is	1
making	1
the	1
world	1
always	1
new.	1
The	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
triumphs	1
of	1
modern	1
science	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
Man	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
proud.	1
Science	1
reads	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
distant	1
star	1
and	1
anatomises	1
the	1
atom;	1
foretells	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
the	1
comet's	1
return	1
and	1
predicts	1
the	1
kinds	1
of	1
chickens	1
that	1
will	1
hatch	1
from	1
a	1
dozen	1
eggs;	1
discovers	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
bloweth	1
where	1
it	1
listeth	1
and	1
reduces	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
disorder	1
of	1
disease.	1
Science	1
is	1
always	1
setting	1
forth	1
on	1
Columbus	1
voyages,	1
discovering	1
new	1
worlds	1
and	1
conquering	1
them	1
by	1
understanding.	1
For	1
Knowledge	1
means	1
Foresight	1
and	1
Foresight	1
means	1
Power.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Evolution	1
has	1
influenced	1
all	1
the	1
sciences,	1
forcing	1
us	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
_everything_	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
history	1
behind	1
it,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
travelled	1
far	1
since	1
Darwin's	1
day.	1
The	1
solar	1
system,	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
mountain	1
ranges,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
deeps,	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
crystals,	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
animals,	1
man	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
social	1
institutions--all	1
must	1
be	1
seen	1
as	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
process	1
of	1
Becoming.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
eighty-odd	1
chemical	1
elements	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
to-day,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
suggestion	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
an	1
inorganic	1
evolution,	1
element	1
giving	1
rise	1
to	1
element,	1
going	1
back	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
some	1
primeval	1
stuff,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
originally	1
derived,	1
infinitely	1
long	1
ago.	1
No	1
idea	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
powerful	1
a	1
tool	1
in	1
the	1
fashioning	1
of	1
New	1
Knowledge	1
as	1
this	1
simple	1
but	1
profound	1
idea	1
of	1
Evolution,	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
continuity	1
of	1
evolution	1
from	1
nebula	1
to	1
social	1
systems	1
comes	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
an	1
increasing	1
control--a	1
promise	1
that	1
Man	1
will	1
become	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
more	1
accurate	1
student,	1
but	1
a	1
more	1
complete	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
modern	1
science	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
is	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
vital	1
than	1
before.	1
Everywhere	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
passage	1
from	1
the	1
static	1
to	1
the	1
dynamic.	1
Thus	1
the	1
new	1
revelations	1
of	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
matter,	1
which	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
the	1
discoveries	1
of	1
men	1
like	1
Professor	1
Sir	1
J.	1
J.	1
Thomson,	1
Professor	1
Sir	1
Ernest	1
Rutherford,	1
and	1
Professor	1
Frederick	1
Soddy,	1
have	1
shown	1
the	1
very	1
dust	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
complexity	1
and	1
an	1
activity	1
heretofore	1
unimagined.	1
Such	1
phrases	1
as	1
"dead"	1
matter	1
and	1
"inert"	1
matter	1
have	1
gone	1
by	1
the	1
board.	1
The	1
new	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
atom	1
amounts	1
almost	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
It	1
bids	1
fair	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
us	1
many	1
of	1
nature's	1
hidden	1
secrets.	1
The	1
atom	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
indivisible	1
particle	1
of	1
matter	1
it	1
was	1
once	1
understood	1
to	1
be.	1
We	1
know	1
now	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
atom	1
within	1
the	1
atom--that	1
what	1
we	1
thought	1
was	1
elementary	1
can	1
be	1
dissociated	1
and	1
broken	1
up.	1
The	1
present-day	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
atom	1
and	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
matter	1
are	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
the	1
comparatively	1
recent	1
discovery	1
of	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
radium,	1
the	1
X-rays,	1
and	1
the	1
wonderful	1
revelations	1
of	1
such	1
instruments	1
as	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
and	1
other	1
highly	1
perfected	1
scientific	1
instruments.	1
The	1
advent	1
of	1
the	1
electron	1
theory	1
has	1
thrown	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
light	1
on	1
what	1
before	1
was	1
hidden	1
or	1
only	1
dimly	1
guessed	1
at.	1
It	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
new	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
framework	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
We	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
realise	1
of	1
what	1
matter	1
is	1
made	1
and	1
what	1
electric	1
phenomena	1
mean.	1
We	1
can	1
glimpse	1
the	1
vast	1
stores	1
of	1
energy	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
matter.	1
The	1
new	1
knowledge	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
about	1
the	1
origin	1
and	1
phenomena,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
planet,	1
but	1
other	1
planets,	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
and	1
the	1
sun.	1
New	1
light	1
is	1
thrown	1
on	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
heat;	1
we	1
can	1
make	1
more	1
than	1
guesses	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
probable	1
age.	1
The	1
great	1
question	1
to-day	1
is:	1
is	1
there	1
_one_	1
primordial	1
substance	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
varying	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
have	1
been	1
evolved?	1
But	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
electrons	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
revolutionary	1
changes	1
which	1
give	1
modern	1
science	1
an	1
entrancing	1
interest.	1
As	1
in	1
chemistry	1
and	1
physics,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
living	1
creatures	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
recent	1
advances	1
that	1
have	1
changed	1
the	1
whole	1
prospect.	1
A	1
good	1
instance	1
is	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
"hormones,"	1
or	1
chemical	1
messengers,	1
which	1
are	1
produced	1
by	1
ductless	1
glands,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
thyroid,	1
the	1
supra-renal,	1
and	1
the	1
pituitary,	1
and	1
are	1
distributed	1
throughout	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
blood.	1
The	1
work	1
of	1
physiologists	1
like	1
Professor	1
Starling	1
and	1
Professor	1
Bayliss	1
has	1
shown	1
that	1
these	1
chemical	1
messengers	1
regulate	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
"pace"	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
bring	1
about	1
that	1
regulated	1
harmony	1
and	1
smoothness	1
of	1
working	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
as	1
health.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
hormones	1
has	1
changed	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
physiology.	1
Our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
body	1
far	1
surpasses	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
generation.	1
The	1
persistent	1
patience	1
of	1
microscopists	1
and	1
technical	1
improvements	1
like	1
the	1
"ultramicroscope"	1
have	1
greatly	1
increased	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
invisible	1
world	1
of	1
life.	1
To	1
the	1
bacteria	1
of	1
a	1
past	1
generation	1
have	1
been	1
added	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
microscopic	1
_animal_	1
microbes,	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
causes	1
Sleeping	1
Sickness.	1
The	1
life-histories	1
and	1
the	1
weird	1
ways	1
of	1
many	1
important	1
parasites	1
have	1
been	1
unravelled;	1
and	1
here	1
again	1
knowledge	1
means	1
mastery.	1
To	1
a	1
degree	1
which	1
has	1
almost	1
surpassed	1
expectations	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
revelation	1
of	1
the	1
intricacy	1
of	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
mortar	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
microscopic	1
study	1
of	1
germ-cells	1
has	1
wonderfully	1
supplemented	1
the	1
epoch-making	1
experimental	1
study	1
of	1
heredity	1
which	1
began	1
with	1
Mendel.	1
It	1
goes	1
without	1
saying	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
call	1
himself	1
educated	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
central	1
and	1
simple	1
ideas	1
of	1
Mendelism	1
and	1
other	1
new	1
departures	1
in	1
biology.	1
The	1
procession	1
of	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
ages	1
and	1
the	1
factors	1
in	1
the	1
sublime	1
movement;	1
the	1
peopling	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
by	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
and	1
the	1
linking	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
life	1
in	1
subtle	1
inter-relations,	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
between	1
flowers	1
and	1
their	1
insect-visitors;	1
the	1
life-histories	1
of	1
individual	1
types	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
inquiry	1
called	1
"experimental	1
embryology"--these	1
also	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
subjects	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
OUTLINE	1
will	1
deal.	1
The	1
behaviour	1
of	1
animals	1
is	1
another	1
fascinating	1
study,	1
leading	1
to	1
a	1
provisional	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
mind.	1
Indeed,	1
no	1
branch	1
of	1
science	1
surpasses	1
in	1
interest	1
that	1
which	1
deals	1
with	1
the	1
ways	1
and	1
habits--the	1
truly	1
wonderful	1
devices,	1
adaptations,	1
and	1
instincts--of	1
insects,	1
birds,	1
and	1
mammals.	1
We	1
no	1
longer	1
deny	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
intelligence	1
to	1
some	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
world--even	1
the	1
line	1
between	1
intelligence	1
and	1
reason	1
is	1
sometimes	1
difficult	1
to	1
find.	1
Fresh	1
contacts	1
between	1
physiology	1
and	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
man's	1
mental	1
life;	1
precise	1
studies	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
children	1
and	1
wild	1
peoples;	1
and	1
new	1
methods	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
psycho-analyst	1
must	1
also	1
receive	1
the	1
attention	1
they	1
deserve,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
giving	1
us	1
a	1
"New	1
Psychology"	1
and	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
psychical	1
research	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
recognised	1
by	1
the	1
open-minded.	1
The	1
general	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
OUTLINE	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
reader	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
concise	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
essentials	1
of	1
present-day	1
science,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
follow	1
with	1
intelligence	1
the	1
modern	1
advance	1
and	1
share	1
appreciatively	1
in	1
man's	1
continued	1
conquest	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom.	1

SOLAR	1
SYSTEM	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
triumphs	1
of	1
modern	1
science	1
naturally	1
opens	1
with	1
Astronomy.	1
The	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
Universe	1
which	1
the	1
astronomer	1
offers	1
to	1
us	1
is	1
imperfect;	1
the	1
lines	1
he	1
traces	1
are	1
often	1
faint	1
and	1
uncertain.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
problems	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
solved,	1
there	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
many	1
about	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
doubt,	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
our	1
great	1
increase	1
in	1
knowledge,	1
there	1
remain	1
just	1
as	1
many	1
which	1
are	1
entirely	1
unsolved.	1
The	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
structure	1
and	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
[said	1
the	1
great	1
astronomer	1
Simon	1
Newcomb]	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
far-reaching	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
mind	1
has	1
to	1
deal.	1
Its	1
solution	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
ultimate	1
object	1
of	1
stellar	1
astronomy,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
reaching	1
which	1
has	1
occupied	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
thinkers	1
since	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
civilisation.	1
Before	1
our	1
time	1
the	1
problem	1
could	1
be	1
considered	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
imaginative	1
or	1
the	1
speculative	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
Although	1
we	1
can	1
to-day	1
attack	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
limited	1
extent	1
by	1
scientific	1
methods,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
scarcely	1
taken	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
toward	1
the	1
actual	1
solution....	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
in	1
time?	1
Is	1
it	1
fitted	1
to	1
last	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
its	1
present	1
form,	1
or	1
does	1
it	1
contain	1
within	1
itself	1
the	1
seeds	1
of	1
dissolution?	1
Must	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
in	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
ages,	1
be	1
transformed	1
into	1
something	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
now	1
is?	1
This	1
question	1
is	1
intimately	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
the	1
stars	1
form	1
a	1
system.	1
If	1
they	1
do,	1
we	1
may	1
suppose	1
that	1
system	1
to	1
be	1
permanent	1
in	1
its	1
general	1
features;	1
if	1
not,	1
we	1
must	1
look	1
further	1
for	1
our	1
conclusions.	1
The	1
Heavenly	1
Bodies	1
The	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
fall	1
into	1
two	1
very	1
distinct	1
classes	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
their	1
relation	1
to	1
our	1
Earth	1
is	1
concerned;	1
the	1
one	1
class,	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
one,	1
comprises	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
colony	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
Earth	1
is	1
a	1
member.	1
These	1
bodies	1
are	1
called	1
_planets_,	1
or	1
wanderers.	1
There	1
are	1
eight	1
of	1
them,	1
including	1
the	1
Earth,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
circle	1
round	1
the	1
sun.	1
Their	1
names,	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
their	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
sun,	1
are	1
Mercury,	1
Venus,	1
Earth,	1
Mars,	1
Jupiter,	1
Saturn,	1
Uranus,	1
Neptune,	1
and	1
of	1
these	1
Mercury,	1
the	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
is	1
rarely	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
naked	1
eye.	1
Uranus	1
is	1
practically	1
invisible,	1
and	1
Neptune	1
quite	1
so.	1
These	1
eight	1
planets,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
sun,	1
constitute,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
little	1
colony;	1
this	1
colony	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Solar	1
System.	1
The	1
second	1
class	1
of	1
heavenly	1
bodies	1
are	1
those	1
which	1
lie	1
_outside_	1
the	1
solar	1
system.	1
Every	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
glittering	1
points	1
we	1
see	1
on	1
a	1
starlit	1
night	1
is	1
at	1
an	1
immensely	1
greater	1
distance	1
from	1
us	1
than	1
is	1
any	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Solar	1
System.	1
Yet	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
little	1
colony	1
of	1
ours,	1
judged	1
by	1
terrestrial	1
standards,	1
are	1
at	1
enormous	1
distances	1
from	1
one	1
another.	1
If	1
a	1
shell	1
were	1
shot	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
Neptune's	1
orbit	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
five	1
hundred	1
years	1
to	1
complete	1
its	1
journey.	1
Yet	1
this	1
distance,	1
the	1
greatest	1
in	1
the	1
Solar	1
System	1
as	1
now	1
known	1
(excepting	1
the	1
far	1
swing	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
comets),	1
is	1
insignificant	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
distances	1
of	1
the	1
stars.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
stars	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
is	1
Alpha	1
Centauri,	1
estimated	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
twenty-five	1
million	1
millions	1
of	1
miles	1
away.	1
Sirius,	1
the	1
brightest	1
star	1
in	1
the	1
firmament,	1
is	1
double	1
this	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
We	1
must	1
imagine	1
the	1
colony	1
of	1
planets	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
belong	1
as	1
a	1
compact	1
little	1
family	1
swimming	1
in	1
an	1
immense	1
void.	1
At	1
distances	1
which	1
would	1
take	1
our	1
shell,	1
not	1
hundreds,	1
but	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
to	1
traverse,	1
we	1
reach	1
the	1
stars--or	1
rather,	1
a	1
star,	1
for	1
the	1
distances	1
between	1
stars	1
are	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
nearest	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
our	1
Sun.	1
The	1
Earth,	1
the	1
planet	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
live,	1
is	1
a	1
mighty	1
globe	1
bounded	1
by	1
a	1
crust	1
of	1
rock	1
many	1
miles	1
in	1
thickness;	1
the	1
great	1
volumes	1
of	1
water	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
our	1
oceans	1
lie	1
in	1
the	1
deeper	1
hollows	1
of	1
the	1
crust.	1
Above	1
the	1
surface	1
an	1
ocean	1
of	1
invisible	1
gas,	1
the	1

Except	1
when	1
the	1
winds	1
rise	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
speed,	1
we	1
seem	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
tranquil	1
world.	1
At	1
night,	1
when	1
the	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
passes	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
atmosphere,	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
planets	1
seem	1
to	1
move	1
across	1
the	1
heavens	1
with	1
a	1
stately	1
and	1
solemn	1
slowness.	1
It	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
discoveries	1
of	1
modern	1
astronomy	1
that	1
this	1
movement	1
is	1
only	1
apparent.	1
The	1
apparent	1
creeping	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
across	1
the	1
heavens	1
at	1
night	1
is	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
turns	1
upon	1
its	1
axis	1
once	1
in	1
every	1
twenty-four	1
hours.	1
When	1
we	1
remember	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
implies	1
a	1
prodigious	1
speed.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
the	1
earth	1
revolves	1
round	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
a	1
speed	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
miles	1
a	1
minute.	1
Its	1
path	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
year	1
in	1
year	1
out,	1
measures	1
about	1
580,000,000	1
miles.	1
The	1
earth	1
is	1
held	1
closely	1
to	1
this	1
path	1
by	1
the	1
gravitational	1
pull	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
which	1
has	1
a	1
mass	1
333,432	1
times	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
If	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
the	1
sun	1
ceased	1
to	1
exert	1
this	1
pull	1
the	1
earth	1
would	1
instantly	1
fly	1
off	1
into	1
space	1
straight	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
moving	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
at	1
a	1
tangent.	1
This	1
tendency	1
to	1
fly	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
tangent	1
is	1
continuous.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
balance	1
between	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
sun's	1
pull	1
which	1
keeps	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
her	1
almost	1
circular	1
orbit.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
the	1
seven	1
other	1
planets	1
are	1
held	1
to	1
their	1
orbits.	1
Circling	1
round	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
circles	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
is	1
our	1
moon.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
moon	1
passes	1
directly	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
cuts	1
off	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
us.	1
We	1
then	1
have	1
a	1
total	1
or	1
partial	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
At	1
other	1
times	1
the	1
earth	1
passes	1
directly	1
between	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
causes	1
an	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
great	1
ball	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
naturally	1
trails	1
a	1
mighty	1
shadow	1
across	1
space,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
is	1
"eclipsed"	1
when	1
it	1
passes	1
into	1
this.	1
The	1
other	1
seven	1
planets,	1
five	1
of	1
which	1
have	1
moons	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
circle	1
round	1
the	1
sun	1
as	1
the	1
earth	1
does.	1
The	1
sun's	1
mass	1
is	1
immensely	1
larger	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
planets	1
put	1
together,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
drawn	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
perish	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
travel	1
rapidly	1
round	1
it	1
in	1
gigantic	1
orbits.	1
So	1
the	1
eight	1
planets,	1
spinning	1
round	1
on	1
their	1
axes,	1
follow	1
their	1
fixed	1
paths	1
round	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
planets	1
are	1
secondary	1
bodies,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
most	1
important,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
globes	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
life,	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
life.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
be	1
transported	1
in	1
some	1
magical	1
way	1
to	1
an	1
immense	1
distance	1
in	1
space	1
above	1
the	1
sun,	1
we	1
should	1
see	1
our	1
Solar	1
System	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
drawn	1
in	1
the	1
accompanying	1
diagram	1
(Fig.	1
1),	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
planets	1
would	1
be	1
mere	1
specks,	1
faintly	1
visible	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
which	1
they	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
sun.	1
(This	1
diagram	1
is	1
drawn	1
approximately	1
to	1
scale.)	1
If	1
we	1
moved	1
still	1
farther	1
away,	1
trillions	1
of	1
miles	1
away,	1
the	1
planets	1
would	1
fade	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
view,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
shrink	1
into	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
fire,	1
a	1
star.	1
And	1
here	1
you	1
begin	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
_The	1
sun	1
is	1
a	1
star.	1
The	1

Our	1
sun	1
looks	1
big	1
simply	1
because	1
of	1
its	1
comparative	1
nearness	1
to	1
us.	1
The	1
universe	1
is	1
a	1
stupendous	1
collection	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
stars	1
or	1
suns,	1
many	1
of	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
planetary	1
families	1
like	1
ours.	1

The	1

How	1
many	1
stars	1
are	1
there?	1
A	1
glance	1
at	1
a	1
photograph	1
of	1
star-clouds	1
will	1
tell	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1
to	1
count	1
them.	1
The	1
fine	1
photograph	1
reproduced	1
in	1
Figure	1
2	1
represents	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
patch	1
of	1
that	1
pale-white	1
belt,	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way,	1
which	1
spans	1
the	1
sky	1
at	1
night.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
particularly	1
rich	1
area	1
of	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way,	1
but	1
the	1
entire	1
belt	1
of	1
light	1
has	1
been	1
resolved	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
into	1
masses	1
or	1
clouds	1
of	1
stars.	1
Astronomers	1
have	1
counted	1
the	1
stars	1
in	1
typical	1
districts	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
partial	1
counts	1
we	1
get	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
total	1
number	1
of	1
stars.	1
There	1
are	1
estimated	1
to	1
be	1
between	1
two	1
and	1
three	1
thousand	1
million	1
stars.	1
Yet	1
these	1
stars	1
are	1
separated	1
by	1
inconceivable	1
distances	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
triumphs	1
of	1
modern	1
astronomy	1
to	1
have	1
mastered,	1
so	1
far,	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
For	1
several	1
centuries	1
astronomers	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
relative	1
distances	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
planets.	1
If	1
they	1
could	1
discover	1
the	1
actual	1
distance	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
planet	1
from	1
any	1
other,	1
they	1
could	1
at	1
once	1
tell	1
all	1
the	1
distances	1
within	1
the	1
Solar	1
System.	1
The	1
sun	1
is,	1
on	1
the	1
latest	1
measurements,	1
at	1
an	1
average	1
distance	1
of	1
92,830,000	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
orbit	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
true	1
circle,	1
this	1
distance	1
varies.	1
This	1
means	1
that	1
in	1
six	1
months	1
from	1
now	1
the	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
right	1
at	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
its	1
path	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
or	1
185,000,000	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
now.	1
Viewed	1
or	1
photographed	1
from	1
two	1
positions	1
so	1
wide	1
apart,	1
the	1
nearest	1
stars	1
show	1
a	1
tiny	1
"shift"	1
against	1
the	1
background	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
stars,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
mathematician.	1
He	1
can	1
calculate	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
any	1
star	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
show	1
this	1
"shift."	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
nearest	1
star	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
recently	1
discovered	1
star,	1
is	1
twenty-five	1
trillion	1
miles	1
away.	1
Only	1
thirty	1
stars	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
within	1
a	1
hundred	1
trillion	1
miles	1
of	1
us.	1
This	1
way	1
of	1
measuring	1
does	1
not,	1
however,	1
take	1
us	1
very	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
stars	1
within	1
five	1
hundred	1
trillion	1
miles	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
distance	1
the	1
"shift"	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
against	1
the	1
background	1
(parallax,	1
the	1
astronomer	1
calls	1
it)	1
is	1
so	1
minute	1
that	1
figures	1
are	1
very	1
uncertain.	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
astronomer	1
takes	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
method.	1
He	1
learns	1
the	1
different	1
types	1
of	1
stars,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
deduce	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
accurately	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
of	1
a	1
known	1
type	1
from	1
its	1
faintness.	1
He,	1
of	1
course,	1
has	1
instruments	1
for	1
gauging	1
their	1
light.	1
As	1
a	1
result	1
of	1
twenty	1
years	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
field,	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
distant	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
are	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
trillion	1
(100,000,000,000,000,000)	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sun.	1
Our	1
sun	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
central	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
or	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
trillion	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
actual	1
centre.	1
The	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
which	1
are	1
all	1
outside	1
our	1
Solar	1
System,	1
are	1
spread	1
out,	1
apparently,	1
in	1
an	1
enormous	1
disc-like	1
collection,	1
so	1
vast	1
that	1
even	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light,	1
which	1
travels	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
186,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second,	1
would	1
take	1
50,000	1
years	1
to	1
travel	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
This,	1
then	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
our	1
universe.	1
Are	1
there	1
other	1
Universes?	1
Why	1
do	1
we	1
say	1
"our	1
universe"?	1
Why	1
not	1
_the_	1
universe?	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
believed	1
by	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
most	1
distinguished	1
astronomers	1
that	1
our	1
colossal	1
family	1
of	1
stars	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
many	1
universes.	1
By	1
a	1
universe	1
an	1
astronomer	1
means	1
any	1
collection	1
of	1
stars	1
which	1
are	1
close	1
enough	1
to	1
control	1
each	1
other's	1
movements	1
by	1
gravitation;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
many	1
universes,	1
in	1
this	1
sense,	1
separated	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
profound	1
abysses	1
of	1
space.	1
Probably	1
there	1
are.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
certain	1
strange	1
objects	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
which	1
are	1
called	1
"spiral	1
nebulæ(Fig	1
4).	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
at	1
a	1
later	1
stage	1
what	1
a	1
nebula	1
is,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
some	1
astronomers	1
regard	1
these	1
spiral	1
nebulæs	1
worlds	1
"in	1
the	1
making."	1
But	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
eminent	1
astronomers	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
separate	1
universes--"island-universes"	1
they	1
call	1
them--or	1
great	1
collections	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
stars	1
like	1
our	1
universe.	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
peculiarities	1

THE	1
SOLAR	1

THE	1
SUN	1
§	1
1	1
But	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
Solar	1
System,	1
and	1
consider	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
little	1
colony.	1
Within	1
the	1
Solar	1
System	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
problems	1
that	1
interest	1
us.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
size,	1
mass,	1
and	1
distance	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
planets?	1
What	1
satellites,	1
like	1
our	1
Moon,	1
do	1
they	1
possess?	1
What	1
are	1
their	1
temperatures?	1
And	1
those	1
other,	1
sporadic	1
members	1
of	1
our	1
system,	1
comets	1
and	1
meteors,	1
what	1
are	1
they?	1
What	1
are	1
their	1
movements?	1
How	1
do	1
they	1
originate?	1
And	1
the	1
Sun	1
itself,	1
what	1
is	1
its	1
composition,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
its	1
heat,	1
how	1
did	1
it	1
originate?	1
Is	1
it	1
running	1
down?	1
These	1
last	1
questions	1
introduce	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
astronomy	1
which	1
is	1
concerned	1
with	1
the	1
physical	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
a	1
study	1
which,	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
many	1
years	1
ago,	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
appeared	1
inconceivable.	1
But	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
enables	1
us	1
to	1
answer	1
even	1
these	1
questions,	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
opens	1
up	1
questions	1
of	1
yet	1
greater	1
interest.	1
We	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
can	1
be	1
arranged	1
in	1
an	1
order	1
of	1
development--that	1
there	1
are	1
stars	1
at	1
all	1
stages	1
of	1
their	1
life-history.	1
The	1
main	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
stellar	1
universe	1
can	1
be	1
worked	1
out.	1
In	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
stars	1
we	1
have	1
furnaces	1
with	1
temperatures	1
enormously	1
high;	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
conditions	1
that	1
substances	1
are	1
resolved	1
into	1
their	1
simplest	1
forms,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
thus	1
we	1
are	1
enabled	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
primitive	1
forms	1
of	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
direction	1
that	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
(which	1
we	1
shall	1
refer	1
to	1
immediately)	1
has	1
helped	1
us	1
so	1
much.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
this	1
wonderful	1
instrument	1
that	1
we	1
owe	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
stars,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
see.	1
"That	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
will	1
detect	1
the	1
millionth	1
of	1
a	1
milligram	1
of	1
matter,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
account	1
has	1
discovered	1
new	1
elements,	1
commands	1
our	1
admiration;	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
find	1
in	1
addition	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
detect	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
trillions	1
of	1
miles	1
away,	1
and	1
moreover,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
measure	1
the	1
velocities	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
are	1
moving	1
with	1
an	1
absurdly	1
small	1
per	1
cent.	1
of	1
possible	1
error,	1
we	1
can	1
easily	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
the	1
statement	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
instrument	1
ever	1
devised	1
by	1
the	1
brain	1
and	1
hand	1
of	1
man."	1
Such	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
questions	1
with	1
which	1
modern	1
astronomy	1
deals.	1
To	1
answer	1
them	1
requires	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
instruments	1
of	1
almost	1
incredible	1
refinement	1
and	1
exactitude	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
full	1
resources	1
of	1
mathematical	1
genius.	1
Whether	1
astronomy	1
be	1
judged	1
from	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
phenomena	1
studied,	1
the	1
vast	1
masses,	1
the	1
immense	1
distances,	1
the	1
æs	1
of	1
time,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
judged	1
as	1
a	1
monument	1
of	1
human	1
ingenuity,	1
patience,	1
and	1
the	1
rarest	1
type	1
of	1
genius,	1
it	1
is	1
certainly	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
grandest,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oldest,	1
of	1
the	1
sciences.	1
The	1
Solar	1
System	1
In	1
the	1
Solar	1
System	1
we	1
include	1
all	1
those	1
bodies	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
sun	1
which	1
circulate	1
round	1
it	1
at	1
various	1
distances,	1
deriving	1
their	1
light	1
and	1
heat	1
from	1
the	1
sun--the	1
planets	1
and	1
their	1
moons,	1
certain	1
comets	1
and	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
meteors:	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
all	1
bodies	1
whose	1
movements	1
in	1
space	1
are	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
gravitational	1
pull	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
Sun	1
Thanks	1
to	1
our	1
wonderful	1
modern	1
instruments	1
and	1
the	1
ingenious	1
methods	1
used	1
by	1
astronomers,	1
we	1
have	1
to-day	1
a	1
remarkable	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
the	1
frontispiece.	1
The	1
picture	1
represents	1
an	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
sun;	1
the	1
dark	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
has	1
screened	1
the	1
sun's	1
shining	1
disc	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
glare	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
eyes;	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
silvery	1
halo	1
surrounding	1
the	1
great	1
orb	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sun's	1
atmosphere,	1
or	1
"crown"	1
(corona),	1
stretching	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
miles	1
into	1
space	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
soft	1
silvery-looking	1
light;	1
probably	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
light	1
is	1
sunlight	1
reflected	1
from	1
particles	1
of	1
dust,	1
although	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
shows	1
an	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
corona	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
far	1
been	1
detected	1
anywhere	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
and	1
which	1
in	1
consequence	1
has	1
been	1
named	1
Coronium.	1
We	1
next	1
notice	1
in	1
the	1
illustration	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
the	1
halo	1
there	1
are	1
red	1
flames	1
peeping	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
hidden	1
disc.	1
When	1
one	1
remembers	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
866,000	1
miles	1
in	1
diameter,	1
one	1
hardly	1
needs	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
these	1
flames	1
are	1
really	1
gigantic.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
presently.	1
Regions	1
of	1
the	1
Sun	1
The	1
astronomer	1
has	1
divided	1
the	1
sun	1
into	1
definite	1
concentric	1
regions	1
or	1
layers.	1
These	1
layers	1
envelop	1
the	1
nucleus	1
or	1
central	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
somewhat	1
as	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
envelops	1
our	1
earth.	1
It	1
is	1
through	1
these	1
vapour	1
layers	1
that	1
the	1
bright	1
white	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
seen.	1
Of	1
the	1
innermost	1
region,	1
the	1
heart	1
or	1
nucleus	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
we	1
know	1
almost	1
nothing.	1
The	1
central	1
body	1
or	1
nucleus	1
is	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
brilliantly	1
luminous	1
envelope	1
or	1
layer	1
of	1
vaporous	1
matter	1
which	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
see	1
when	1
we	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
astronomer	1
calls	1
the	1
photosphere.	1
Above--that	1
is,	1
overlying--the	1
photosphere	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
second	1
layer	1
of	1
glowing	1
gases,	1
which	1
is	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
reversing	1
layer.	1
This	1
layer	1
is	1
cooler	1
than	1
the	1
underlying	1
photosphere;	1
it	1
forms	1
a	1
veil	1
of	1
smoke-like	1
haze	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
from	1
500	1
to	1
1,000	1
miles	1
in	1
thickness.	1
A	1
third	1
layer	1
or	1
envelope	1
immediately	1
lying	1
over	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
region	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
chromosphere.	1
The	1
chromosphere	1
extends	1
from	1
5,000	1
to	1
10,000	1
miles	1
in	1
thickness--a	1
"sea"	1
of	1
red	1
tumultuous	1
surging	1
fire.	1
Chief	1
among	1
the	1
glowing	1
gases	1
is	1
the	1
vapour	1
of	1
hydrogen.	1
The	1
intense	1
white	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
photosphere	1
beneath	1
shines	1
through	1
this	1
layer,	1
overpowering	1
its	1
brilliant	1
redness.	1
From	1
the	1
uppermost	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
chromosphere	1
great	1
fiery	1
tongues	1
of	1
glowing	1
hydrogen	1
and	1
calcium	1
vapour	1
shoot	1
out	1
for	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
miles,	1
driven	1
outward	1
by	1
some	1
prodigious	1
expulsive	1
force.	1
It	1
is	1
these	1
red	1
"prominences"	1
which	1
are	1
such	1
a	1
notable	1
feature	1
in	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
already	1
referred	1
to.	1
During	1
the	1
solar	1
eclipse	1
of	1
1919	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
red	1
flames	1
rose	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
seven	1
hours	1
from	1
a	1
height	1
of	1
130,000	1
miles	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
500,000	1
miles	1
above	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface.	1
This	1
immense	1
column	1
of	1
red-hot	1
gas,	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
times	1
the	1
thickness	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
was	1
soaring	1
upward	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
60,000	1
miles	1
an	1
hour.	1
These	1
flaming	1
jets	1
or	1
prominences	1
shooting	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
chromosphere	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
every	1
day	1
by	1
the	1
naked	1
eye;	1
the	1
dazzling	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
obscures	1
them,	1
gigantic	1
as	1
they	1
are.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
observed,	1
however,	1
by	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
any	1
day,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
visible	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
during	1
an	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
Some	1
extraordinary	1
outbursts	1
have	1
been	1
witnessed.	1
Thus	1
the	1
late	1
Professor	1
Young	1
described	1
one	1
on	1
September	1
7,	1
1871,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
examining	1
a	1
prominence	1
by	1
the	1
spectroscope:	1
It	1
had	1
remained	1
unchanged	1
since	1
noon	1
of	1
the	1
previous	1
day--a	1
long,	1
low,	1
quiet-looking	1
cloud,	1
not	1
very	1
dense,	1
or	1
brilliant,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
remarkable	1
except	1
for	1
its	1
size.	1
At	1
12:30	1
p.m.	1
the	1
Professor	1
left	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
and	1
on	1
returning	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
later	1
to	1
his	1
observations,	1
he	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
gigantic	1
Sun	1
flame	1
shattered	1
to	1
pieces.	1
The	1
solar	1
atmosphere	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
flying	1
debris,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
portions	1
reached	1
a	1
height	1
of	1
100,000	1
miles	1
above	1
the	1
solar	1
surface.	1
Moving	1
with	1
a	1
velocity	1
which,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
93,000,000	1
miles,	1
was	1
almost	1
perceptible	1
to	1
the	1
eye,	1
these	1
fragments	1
doubled	1
their	1
height	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
On	1
January	1
30,	1
1885,	1
another	1
distinguished	1
solar	1
observer,	1
the	1
late	1
Professor	1
Tacchini	1
of	1
Rome,	1
observed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
prominences	1
ever	1
seen	1
by	1
man.	1
Its	1
height	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
142,000	1
miles--eighteen	1
times	1
the	1
diameter	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Another	1
mighty	1
flame	1
was	1
so	1
vast	1
that	1
supposing	1
the	1
eight	1
large	1
planets	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
ranged	1
one	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
prominence	1
would	1
still	1
tower	1
above	1
them.[1]	1

sun.	1
It	1
is	1
through	1
these	1
several	1
transparent	1
layers	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
white	1
light	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1

The	1
Surface	1
of	1
the	1
Sun	1
Here	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
more	1
we	1
know	1
about	1
the	1
photosphere--the	1
sun's	1
surface.	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
photosphere	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
gained	1
most	1
of	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
composition	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
which	1
is	1
believed	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
solid	1
body.	1
Examination	1
of	1
the	1
photosphere	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
outer	1
surface	1
is	1
never	1
at	1
rest.	1
Small	1
bright	1
cloudlets	1
come	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
rapid	1
succession,	1
giving	1
the	1
surface,	1
through	1
contrasts	1
in	1
luminosity,	1
a	1
granular	1
appearance.	1
Of	1
course,	1
to	1
be	1
visible	1
at	1
all	1
at	1
92,830,000	1
miles	1
the	1
cloudlets	1
cannot	1
be	1
small.	1
They	1
imply	1
enormous	1
activity	1
in	1
the	1
photosphere.	1
If	1
we	1
might	1
speak	1
picturesquely	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface	1
resembles	1
a	1
boiling	1
ocean	1
of	1
white-hot	1
metal	1
vapours.	1
We	1
have	1
to-day	1
a	1
wonderful	1
instrument,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
described	1
later,	1
which	1
dilutes,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
general	1
glare	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
enables	1
us	1
to	1
observe	1
these	1
fiery	1
eruptions	1
at	1
any	1
hour.	1
The	1
"oceans"	1
of	1
red-hot	1
gas	1
and	1
white-hot	1
metal	1
vapour	1
at	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface	1
are	1
constantly	1
driven	1
by	1
great	1
storms.	1
Some	1
unimaginable	1
energy	1
streams	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
or	1
muscles	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
blows	1
its	1
outer	1
layers	1
into	1
gigantic	1
shreds,	1
as	1
it	1
were.	1
The	1
actual	1
temperature	1
at	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface,	1
or	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
surface--the	1
photosphere--is,	1
of	1
course,	1
unknown,	1
but	1
careful	1
calculation	1
suggests	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
5,000°	1
C.	1
to	1
7,000°	1
C.	1
The	1
interior	1
is	1
vastly	1
hotter.	1
We	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
conception	1
of	1
such	1
temperatures	1
as	1
must	1
exist	1
there.	1
Not	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
obdurate	1
solid	1
could	1
resist	1
such	1
temperatures,	1
but	1
would	1
be	1
converted	1
almost	1
instantaneously	1
into	1
gas.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
gas	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
gases	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
enormous	1
pressures	1
that	1
exist	1
on	1
the	1
sun	1
must	1
convert	1
even	1
gases	1
into	1
thick	1
treacly	1
fluids.	1
We	1
can	1
only	1
infer	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
matter.	1
It	1
is	1
beyond	1
our	1
power	1
to	1
reproduce	1
it.	1
Sun-spots	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
brilliant	1
photosphere	1
that	1
the	1
dark	1
areas	1
known	1
as	1
sun-spots	1
appear.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
dark	1
spots--they	1
are	1
dark	1
only	1
by	1
contrast	1
with	1
the	1
photosphere	1
surrounding	1
them--are	1
of	1
enormous	1
size,	1
covering	1
many	1
thousands	1
of	1
square	1
miles	1
of	1
surface.	1
What	1
they	1
are	1
we	1
cannot	1
positively	1
say.	1
They	1
look	1
like	1
great	1
cavities	1
in	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface.	1
Some	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
giant	1
whirlpools.	1
Certainly	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
whirling	1
streams	1
of	1
glowing	1
gases	1
with	1
vapours	1
above	1
them	1
and	1
immense	1
upward	1
and	1
downward	1
currents	1
within	1
them.	1
Round	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
sun-spots	1
rise	1
great	1
tongues	1
of	1
flame.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
popularly	1
known	1
fact	1
about	1
sun-spots	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
somehow	1
connected	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
magnetic	1
storms	1
on	1
earth.	1
These	1
magnetic	1
storms	1
manifest	1
themselves	1
in	1
interruptions	1
of	1
our	1
telegraphic	1
and	1
telephonic	1
communications,	1
in	1
violent	1
disturbances	1
of	1
the	1
mariner's	1
compass,	1
and	1
in	1
exceptional	1
auroral	1
displays.	1
The	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
sets	1
of	1
phenomena	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted,	1
even	1
although	1
at	1
times	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
spot	1
on	1
the	1
sun	1
without	1
any	1
corresponding	1
"magnetic	1
storm"	1
effects	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
A	1
surprising	1
fact	1
about	1
sun-spots	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
show	1
definite	1
periodic	1
variations	1
in	1
number.	1
The	1
best-defined	1
period	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
about	1
eleven	1
years.	1
During	1
this	1
period	1
the	1
spots	1
increase	1
to	1
a	1
maximum	1
in	1
number	1
and	1
then	1
diminish	1
to	1
a	1
minimum,	1
the	1
variation	1
being	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
regular.	1
Now	1
this	1
can	1
only	1
mean	1
one	1
thing.	1
To	1
be	1
periodic	1
the	1
spots	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
deep-seated	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
fundamental	1
facts	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
structure	1
and	1
activities.	1
Looked	1
at	1
from	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
their	1
importance	1
becomes	1
great.	1

THE	1
AURORA	1
BOREALIS	1
The	1
aurora	1
borealis	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
spectacles	1
in	1
the	1
sky.	1
The	1
colours	1
and	1
shape	1
change	1
every	1
instant;	1
sometimes	1
a	1
fan-like	1
cluster	1
of	1
rays,	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
long	1
golden	1
draperies	1
gliding	1
one	1
over	1
the	1
other.	1
Blue,	1
green,	1
yellow,	1
red,	1
and	1
white	1
combine	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
glorious	1
display	1
of	1
colour.	1
The	1
theory	1
of	1
its	1
origin	1
is	1
still,	1
in	1
part,	1
obscure,	1
but	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
aurora	1
is	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
magnetic	1
phenomena	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
therefore	1
is	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
electrical	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
sun.]	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
sun-spots	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
sun's	1
surface	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
rotate	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
speed.	1
The	1
"equatorial"	1
regions	1
are	1
rotating	1
quicker	1
than	1
regions	1
farther	1
north	1
or	1
south.	1
A	1
point	1
forty-five	1
degrees	1
from	1
the	1
equator	1
seems	1
to	1
take	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
days	1
longer	1
to	1
complete	1
one	1
rotation	1
than	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
the	1
equator.	1
This,	1
of	1
course,	1
confirms	1
our	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
solid	1
body.	1
What	1
is	1
its	1
composition?	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
present,	1
in	1
a	1
gaseous	1
state,	1
such	1
well-known	1
elements	1
as	1
sodium,	1
iron,	1
copper,	1
zinc,	1
and	1
magnesium;	1
indeed,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
practically	1
every	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
How	1
do	1
we	1
know?	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
photosphere,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
won	1
most	1
of	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
instrument	1
used	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
is	1
the	1
spectroscope;	1
and	1
before	1
proceeding	1
to	1
deal	1
further	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
its	1
energy	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
describe	1
this	1
instrument.	1
A	1
WONDERFUL	1
INSTRUMENT	1
AND	1
WHAT	1
IT	1
REVEALS	1
The	1
spectroscope	1
is	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
analysing	1
light.	1
So	1
important	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
revelations	1
it	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
describe	1
it	1
fully.	1
Every	1
substance	1
to	1
be	1
examined	1
must	1
first	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
glow,	1
made	1
luminous;	1
and	1
as	1
nearly	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
_is_	1
luminous	1
the	1
instrument	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
range	1
in	1
Astronomy.	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
analysing	1
light,	1
we	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
light	1
may	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
into	1
waves	1
of	1
different	1
lengths.	1
What	1
we	1
call	1
light	1
is	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
minute	1
waves	1
in	1
ether,	1
and	1
these	1
waves	1
are--measuring	1
them	1
from	1
crest	1
to	1
crest,	1
so	1
to	1
say--of	1
various	1
lengths.	1
Each	1
wave-length	1
corresponds	1
to	1
a	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
rainbow.	1
The	1
shortest	1
waves	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
violet	1
colour,	1
and	1
the	1
largest	1
waves	1
cause	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
red.	1
The	1
rainbow,	1
in	1
fact,	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
natural	1
spectrum.	1
(The	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
rainbow	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
moisture-laden	1
air	1
has	1
sorted	1
out	1
these	1
waves,	1
in	1
the	1
sun's	1
light,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
length.)	1
Now	1
the	1
simplest	1
form	1
of	1
spectroscope	1
is	1
a	1
glass	1
prism--a	1
triangular-shaped	1
piece	1
of	1
glass.	1
If	1
white	1
light	1
(sunlight,	1
for	1
example)	1
passes	1
through	1
a	1
glass	1
prism,	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
rainbow-tinted	1
colours.	1
Anyone	1
can	1
notice	1
this	1
effect	1
when	1
sunlight	1
is	1
shining	1
through	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
cut	1
glass--the	1
stopper	1
of	1
a	1
wine	1
decanter,	1
for	1
instance.	1
If,	1
instead	1
of	1
catching	1
with	1
the	1
eye	1
the	1
coloured	1
lights	1
as	1
they	1
emerge	1
from	1
the	1
glass	1
prism,	1
we	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
a	1
screen,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
pass,	1
by	1
continuous	1
gradations,	1
from	1
red	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
screen,	1
through	1
orange,	1
yellow,	1
green,	1
blue,	1
and	1
indigo,	1
to	1
violet	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end.	1
_In	1
other	1
words,	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
white	1
light	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
rays	1
of	1
these	1
several	1
colours.	1
They	1
go	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
effect	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
white._	1
And	1
now	1
just	1
as	1
water	1
can	1
be	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
its	1
two	1
elements,	1
oxygen	1
and	1
hydrogen,	1
so	1
sunlight	1
can	1
be	1
broken	1
up	1
into	1
its	1
primary	1
colours,	1
which	1
are	1
those	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
mentioned.	1
This	1
range	1
of	1
colours,	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
solar	1
spectrum,	1
and	1
these	1
are,	1
from	1
the	1
spectroscopic	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
primary	1
colours.	1
Each	1
shade	1
of	1
colour	1
has	1
its	1
definite	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
spectrum.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
each	1
shade	1
of	1
colour	1
(corresponding	1
to	1
its	1
wave-length)	1
is	1
reflected	1
through	1
a	1
certain	1
fixed	1
angle	1
on	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
prism.	1
Every	1
possible	1
kind	1
of	1
light	1
has	1
its	1
definite	1
position,	1
and	1
is	1
denoted	1
by	1
a	1
number	1
which	1
gives	1
the	1
wave-length	1
of	1
the	1
vibrations	1
constituting	1
that	1
particular	1
kind	1
of	1
light.	1
Now,	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1
light	1
besides	1
sunlight	1
can	1
be	1
analysed.	1
Light	1
from	1
any	1
substance	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
incandescent	1
may	1
be	1
observed	1
with	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
each	1
element	1
can	1
be	1
thus	1
separated.	1
It	1
is	1
found	1
that	1
each	1
substance	1
(in	1
the	1
same	1
conditions	1
of	1
pressure,	1
etc.)	1
gives	1
a	1
constant	1
spectrum	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
_Each	1
metal	1
displays	1
its	1
own	1
distinctive	1
colour.	1
It	1
is	1
obvious,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
spectrum	1
provides	1
the	1
means	1
for	1
identifying	1
a	1
particular	1
substance._	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
method	1
that	1
we	1
discovered	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
such	1
well-known	1
elements	1
as	1
sodium,	1
iron,	1
copper,	1
zinc,	1
and	1
magnesium.	1

Every	1
chemical	1
element	1
known,	1
then,	1
has	1
a	1
distinctive	1
spectrum	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
raised	1
to	1
incandescence,	1
and	1
this	1
distinctive	1
spectrum	1
is	1
as	1
reliable	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
identification	1
for	1
the	1
element	1
as	1

human	1

for	1
its	1
owner.	1

in	1
a	1
remote	1
star	1
makes	1
no	1
difference	1
to	1
the	1
spectroscope;	1
if	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
any	1
substance	1
reaches	1
it,	1
that	1
substance	1
will	1
be	1
recognised	1
and	1
identified	1
by	1
the	1
characteristic	1
set	1
of	1
waves.	1
The	1
spectrum	1
of	1
a	1
glowing	1
mass	1
of	1
gas	1
will	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
bright	1
lines	1
of	1
various	1
colours,	1
and	1
at	1
various	1
intervals;	1
corresponding	1
to	1
each	1
kind	1
of	1
gas,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
distinctive	1
arrangement	1
of	1
bright	1
lines.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
glowing	1
gas	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
a	1
cool	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
_same_	1
gas	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
dark	1
lines	1
replace	1
the	1
bright	1
lines	1
in	1
the	1
spectrum,	1
the	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
cool	1
gas	1
absorbs	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
light	1
emitted	1
by	1
the	1
hot	1
gas.	1
Experiments	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
important	1
general	1
statement	1
that	1
every	1
gas,	1
when	1
cold,	1
absorbs	1
the	1
same	1
rays	1
of	1
light	1
which	1
it	1
emits	1
when	1
hot.	1
Crossing	1
the	1
solar	1
spectrum	1
are	1
hundreds	1
and	1
hundreds	1
of	1
dark	1
lines.	1
These	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
be	1
explained,	1
because	1
this	1
fact	1
of	1
discriminative	1
absorption	1
was	1
not	1
known.	1
We	1
understand	1
now.	1
The	1
sun's	1
white	1
light	1
comes	1
from	1
the	1
photosphere,	1
but	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
photosphere	1
there	1
is,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
another	1
solar	1
envelope	1
of	1
relatively	1
cooler	1
vapours--the	1
reversing	1
layer.	1
Each	1
constituent	1
element	1
in	1
this	1
outer	1
envelope	1
stops	1
its	1
own	1
kind	1
of	1
light,	1
that	1
is,	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
light	1
made	1
by	1
incandescent	1
atoms	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
photosphere.	1
The	1
"stoppages"	1
register	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
solar	1
spectrum	1
as	1
dark	1
lines	1
placed	1
exactly	1
where	1
the	1
corresponding	1
bright	1
lines	1
would	1
have	1
been.	1
The	1
explanation	1
once	1
attained,	1
dark	1
lines	1
became	1
as	1
significant	1
as	1
bright	1
lines.	1
The	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
composition	1
was	1
out.	1
We	1
have	1
found	1
practically	1
every	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
earth.	1
We	1
have	1
identified	1
an	1
element	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
before	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
isolate	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
even	1
to	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
coolest	1
places	1
on	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
centres	1
of	1
sun-spots,	1
where	1
alone	1
the	1
temperature	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
fallen	1
sufficiently	1
low	1
to	1
allow	1
chemical	1
compounds	1
to	1
form.	1
It	1
is	1
thus	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
determine	1
what	1
the	1
stars,	1
comets,	1
or	1
nebulære	1
made	1
of.	1
A	1
Unique	1
Discovery	1
In	1
1868	1
Sir	1
Norman	1
Lockyer	1
detected	1
a	1
light	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
prominences	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
by	1
any	1
substance	1
known	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
attributed	1
this	1
to	1
an	1
unknown	1
gas	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
helium,	1
from	1
the	1
Greek	1
_helios_,	1
the	1
sun.	1
_In	1
1895	1
Sir	1
William	1
Ramsay	1
discovered	1
in	1
certain	1
minerals	1
the	1
same	1
gas	1
identified	1
by	1
the	1
spectroscope._	1
We	1
can	1
say,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
this	1
gas	1
was	1
discovered	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
nearly	1
thirty	1
years	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
on	1
earth;	1
this	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
long-lost	1
heir	1
is	1
as	1
thrilling	1
a	1
chapter	1
in	1
the	1
detective	1
story	1
of	1
science	1
as	1
any	1
in	1
the	1
sensational	1
stories	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
makes	1
us	1
feel	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
our	1
methods	1
really	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
what	1
elements	1
sun	1
and	1
stars	1
are	1
built	1
up.	1
The	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
corona	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
mentioned	1
indicates	1
a	1
gas	1
still	1
unknown	1
on	1
earth,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
christened	1
Coronium.	1
Measuring	1
the	1
Speed	1
of	1
Light	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all;	1
soon	1
a	1
new	1
use	1
was	1
found	1
for	1
the	1
spectroscope.	1
We	1
found	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
measure	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
of	1
all	1
speeds	1
to	1
measure,	1
speed	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
sight.	1
Movement	1
at	1
right	1
angles	1
to	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
is	1
looking	1
is,	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
sufficient	1
of	1
it,	1
easy	1
to	1
detect,	1
and,	1
if	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
body	1
is	1
known,	1
easy	1
to	1
measure.	1
But	1
movement	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
vision	1
is	1
both	1
difficult	1
to	1
detect	1
and	1
difficult	1
to	1
measure.	1
Yet,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
enormous	1
distances	1
with	1
which	1
astronomers	1
have	1
to	1
deal,	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
can	1
detect	1
such	1
movement	1
and	1
furnish	1
data	1
for	1
its	1
measurement.	1
If	1
a	1
luminous	1
body	1
containing,	1
say,	1
sodium	1
is	1
moving	1
rapidly	1
towards	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
sodium	1
lines	1
in	1
the	1
spectrum	1
have	1
moved	1
slightly	1
from	1
their	1
usual	1
definite	1
positions	1
towards	1
the	1
violet	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
spectrum,	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
position	1
increasing	1
with	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
luminous	1
body.	1
If	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
moving	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
the	1
shifting	1
of	1
the	1
spectral	1
lines	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction,	1
towards	1
the	1
red	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
spectrum.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
have	1
discovered	1
and	1
measured	1
movements	1
that	1
otherwise	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
have	1
revealed	1
themselves	1
unmistakably	1
to	1
us	1
for	1
thousands	1
of	1
years.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
we	1
have	1
watched,	1
and	1
measured	1
the	1
speed	1
of,	1
tremendous	1
movements	1
on	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
so	1
gained	1
proof	1
that	1
the	1
vast	1
disturbances	1
we	1
should	1
expect	1
there	1
actually	1
do	1
occur.	1

THE	1

DYING?	1
§	1
3	1
Now	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
To	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
the	1
most	1
patent	1
and	1
most	1
astonishing	1
fact	1
about	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
its	1
tremendous	1
energy.	1
Heat	1
and	1
light	1
in	1
amazing	1
quantities	1
pour	1
from	1
it	1
without	1
ceasing.	1
Where	1
does	1
this	1
energy	1
come	1
from?	1
Enormous	1
jets	1
of	1
red	1
glowing	1
gases	1
can	1
be	1
seen	1
shooting	1
outwards	1
from	1
the	1
sun,	1
like	1
flames	1
from	1
a	1
fire,	1
for	1
thousands	1
of	1
miles.	1
Does	1
this	1
argue	1
fire,	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
fire	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
scientist	1
is	1
sure.	1
The	1
sun	1
is	1
not	1
burning,	1
and	1
combustion	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
its	1
heat.	1
Combustion	1
is	1
a	1
chemical	1
reaction	1
between	1
atoms.	1
The	1
conditions	1
that	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1
are	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
results	1
are	1
predictable	1
and	1
measurable.	1
But	1
no	1
chemical	1
reaction	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
combustion	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
explain	1
the	1
sun's	1
energy,	1
nor	1
indeed	1
will	1
any	1
ordinary	1
chemical	1
reaction	1
of	1
any	1
kind.	1
If	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
composed	1
of	1
combustible	1
material	1
throughout	1
and	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
combustion	1
as	1
we	1
understand	1
them	1
were	1
always	1
present,	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
burn	1
itself	1
out	1
in	1
some	1
thousands	1
of	1
years,	1
with	1
marked	1
changes	1
in	1
its	1
heat	1
and	1
light	1
production	1
as	1
the	1
process	1
advanced.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
evidence	1
of	1
such	1
changes.	1
There	1
is,	1
instead,	1
strong	1
evidence	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
has	1
been	1
emitting	1
light	1
and	1
heat	1
in	1
prodigious	1
quantities,	1
not	1
for	1
thousands,	1
but	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years.	1
Every	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
knowledge	1
that	1
throws	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
sun's	1
age	1
seems	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
increase	1
rather	1
than	1
decrease	1
of	1
its	1
years.	1
This	1
makes	1
the	1
wonder	1
of	1
its	1
energy	1
greater.	1
And	1
we	1
cannot	1
avoid	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
by	1
saying	1
merely	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
gradually	1
radiating	1
away	1
an	1
energy	1
that	1
originated	1
in	1
some	1
unknown	1
manner,	1
away	1
back	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
things.	1
Reliable	1
calculations	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
years	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
cooling	1
of	1
a	1
globe	1
like	1
the	1
sun	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
run	1
to	1
millions.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
sun's	1
energy	1
must	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
continuous	1
and	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
steady	1
renewal.	1
However	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
acquired	1
its	1
enormous	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
past,	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
some	1
source	1
of	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
present.	1
The	1
best	1
explanation	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
to-day	1
of	1
this	1
continuous	1
accretion	1
of	1
energy	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
shrinkage	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
bulk	1
under	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
gravity.	1
Gravity	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
mysterious	1
forces	1
of	1
nature,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
obvious	1
fact	1
that	1
bodies	1
behave	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
attracted	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
Newton	1
worked	1
out	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
this	1
attraction.	1
We	1
may	1
say,	1
without	1
trying	1
to	1
go	1
too	1
deeply	1
into	1
things,	1
that	1
every	1
particle	1
of	1
matter	1
attracts	1
every	1
other	1
throughout	1
the	1
universe.	1
If	1
the	1
diameter	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
to	1
shrink	1
by	1
one	1
mile	1
all	1
round,	1
this	1
would	1
mean	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
tons	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
one-mile	1
thickness	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
straight	1
drop	1
of	1
one	1
mile	1
towards	1
the	1
centre.	1
And	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
all,	1
because	1
obviously	1
the	1
layers	1
below	1
this	1
outer	1
mile	1
would	1
also	1
drop	1
inwards,	1
each	1
to	1
a	1
less	1
degree	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
above	1
it.	1
What	1
a	1
tremendous	1
movement	1
of	1
matter,	1
however	1
slowly	1
it	1
might	1
take	1
place!	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
tremendous	1
energy	1
would	1
be	1
involved!	1
Astronomers	1
calculate	1
that	1
the	1
above	1
shrinkage	1
of	1
one	1
mile	1
all	1
round	1
would	1
require	1
fifty	1
years	1
for	1
its	1
completion,	1
assuming,	1
reasonably,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
close	1
and	1
continuous	1
relationship	1
between	1
loss	1
of	1
heat	1
by	1
radiation	1
and	1
shrinkage.	1
Even	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
true	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
feel	1
over-anxious	1
on	1
this	1
theory;	1
before	1
the	1
sun	1
became	1
too	1
cold	1
to	1
support	1
life	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
would	1
be	1
required.	1
It	1
was	1
suggested	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
that	1
falls	1
of	1
meteoric	1
matter	1
into	1
the	1
sun	1
would	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
sun's	1
heat.	1
This	1
position	1
is	1
hardly	1
tenable	1
now.	1
The	1
mere	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
meteoric	1
matter	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
hypothesis,	1
apart	1
from	1
other	1
reasons,	1
is	1
against	1
it.	1
There	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
an	1
enormous	1
amount	1
of	1
meteoric	1
matter	1
moving	1
about	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system,	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
following	1
definite	1
routes	1
round	1
the	1
sun	1
like	1
the	1
planets.	1
The	1
stray	1
erratic	1
quantities	1
destined	1
to	1
meet	1
their	1
doom	1
by	1
collision	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
sun's	1
heat.	1
Recent	1
study	1
of	1
radio-active	1
bodies	1
has	1
suggested	1
another	1
factor	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
working	1
powerfully	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
gravitation	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
sun's	1
store	1
of	1
heat.	1
In	1
radio-active	1
bodies	1
certain	1
atoms	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
undergoing	1
disintegration.	1
These	1
atoms	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
splitting	1
up	1
into	1
very	1
minute	1
and	1
primitive	1
constituents.	1
But	1
since	1
matter	1
may	1
be	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
such	1
constituents,	1
may	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
built	1
up	1
from	1
them?	1
The	1
question	1
is	1
whether	1
these	1
"radio-active"	1
elements	1
are	1
undergoing	1
disintegration,	1
or	1
formation,	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
If	1
they	1
are	1
undergoing	1
disintegration--and	1
the	1
sun	1
itself	1
is	1
undoubtedly	1
radio-active--then	1
we	1
have	1
another	1
source	1
of	1
heat	1
for	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
will	1
last	1
indefinitely.	1
THE	1
PLANETS	1
LIFE	1
IN	1
OTHER	1
WORLDS?	1
§	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
stars.	1
Nothing	1
solid	1
or	1
even	1
liquid	1
can	1
exist	1
in	1
such	1
furnaces	1
as	1
they	1
are.	1
Life	1
exists	1
only	1
on	1
planets,	1
and	1
even	1
on	1
these	1
its	1
possibilities	1
are	1
limited.	1
Whether	1
all	1
the	1
stars,	1
or	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
them,	1
have	1
planetary	1
families	1
like	1
our	1
sun,	1
we	1
cannot	1
positively	1
say.	1
If	1
they	1
have,	1
such	1
planets	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
faint	1
and	1
small	1
to	1
be	1
visible	1
tens	1
of	1
trillions	1
of	1
miles	1
away.	1
Some	1
astronomers	1
think	1
that	1
our	1
sun	1
may	1
be	1
exceptional	1
in	1
having	1
planets,	1
but	1
their	1
reasons	1
are	1
speculative	1
and	1
unconvincing.	1
Probably	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
have	1
planets,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
therefore	1
survey	1
the	1
globes	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
solar	1
system	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way	1
extend	1
the	1
results	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
In	1
considering	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
it	1
we	1
may	1
at	1
once	1
rule	1
out	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
planets	1
from	1
the	1
sun,	1
Uranus	1
and	1
Neptune.	1
They	1
are	1
probably	1
intrinsically	1
too	1
hot.	1
We	1
may	1
also	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
nearest	1
planet	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
Mercury.	1
We	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
it	1
turns	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
period	1
as	1
it	1
revolves	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
therefore	1
always	1
present	1
the	1
same	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
sun.	1
This	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
heat	1
on	1
the	1
sunlit	1
side	1
of	1
Mercury	1
is	1
above	1
boiling-point,	1
while	1
the	1
cold	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
must	1
be	1
between	1
two	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
degrees	1
below	1
freezing-point.	1
The	1
Planet	1
Venus	1
The	1
planet	1
Venus,	1
the	1
bright	1
globe	1
which	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
all	1
as	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
evening	1
"star,"	1
seems	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
more	1
promising	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
size	1
as	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
good	1
atmosphere,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
astronomers	1
who	1
believe	1
that,	1
like	1
Mercury,	1
it	1
always	1
presents	1
the	1
same	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
therefore	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
disadvantage--a	1
broiling	1
heat	1
on	1
the	1
sunny	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
space	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
sure.	1
The	1
surface	1
of	1
Venus	1
is	1
so	1
bright--the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
reflected	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
such	1
dense	1
masses	1
of	1
cloud	1
and	1
dust--that	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
trace	1
any	1
permanent	1
markings	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
thus	1
ascertain	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
rotate	1
on	1
its	1
axis.	1
Many	1
astronomers	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
succeeded,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
planet	1
always	1
turns	1
the	1
same	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
sun.	1
If	1
it	1
does,	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
conceive	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
its	1
surface,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
cloud-screen.	1

We	1
turn	1
to	1
Mars;	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
make	1
it	1
clear	1
why	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
speculation	1
about	1
life	1
on	1
Mars,	1
and	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
supposed	1
that,	1
if	1
there	1
_is_	1
life	1
on	1
Mars,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
advanced	1
than	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
Is	1
there	1
Life	1
on	1
Mars?	1
The	1
basis	1
of	1
this	1
belief	1
is	1
that	1
if,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
all	1
the	1
globes	1
in	1
our	1
solar	1
system	1
are	1
masses	1
of	1
metal	1
that	1
are	1
cooling	1
down,	1
the	1
smaller	1
will	1
have	1
cooled	1
down	1
before	1
the	1
larger,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
further	1
ahead	1
in	1
their	1
development.	1
Now	1
Mars	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
cooled	1
at	1
its	1
surface	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
before	1
the	1
earth	1
did.	1
Hence,	1
if	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
life	1
began	1
on	1
Mars	1
at	1
all,	1
it	1
began	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
We	1
cannot	1
guess	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
life-forms	1
would	1
be	1
evolved	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
world,	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
confidently	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
tend	1
toward	1
increasing	1
intelligence;	1
and	1
thus	1
we	1
are	1
disposed	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
highly	1
intelligent	1
beings	1
on	1
Mars.	1
But	1
this	1
argument	1
supposes	1
that	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
life,	1
namely	1
air	1
and	1
water,	1
are	1
found	1
on	1
Mars,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
disputed	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
found	1
there	1
in	1
sufficient	1
quantity.	1
The	1
late	1
Professor	1
Percival	1
Lowell,	1
who	1
made	1
a	1
lifelong	1
study	1
of	1
Mars,	1
maintained	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
hundreds	1
of	1
straight	1
lines	1
drawn	1
across	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
planet,	1
and	1
he	1
claimed	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
beds	1
of	1
vegetation	1
marking	1
the	1
sites	1
of	1
great	1
channels	1
or	1
pipes	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
"Martians"	1
draw	1
water	1
from	1
their	1
polar	1
ocean.	1
Professor	1
W.	1
H.	1
Pickering,	1
another	1
high	1
authority,	1
thinks	1
that	1
the	1
lines	1
are	1
long,	1
narrow	1
marshes	1
fed	1
by	1
moist	1
winds	1
from	1
the	1
poles.	1
There	1
are	1
certainly	1
white	1
polar	1
caps	1
on	1
Mars.	1
They	1
seem	1
to	1
melt	1
in	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
the	1
dark	1
fringe	1
round	1
them	1
grows	1
broader.	1
Other	1
astronomers,	1
however,	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
find	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
water-vapour	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
Mars,	1
and	1
they	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
polar	1
caps	1
may	1
be	1
simply	1
thin	1
sheets	1
of	1
hoar-frost	1
or	1
frozen	1
gas.	1
They	1
point	1
out	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
Mars	1
is	1
certainly	1
scanty,	1
and	1
the	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
so	1
great,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
too	1
cold	1
for	1
the	1
fluid	1
water	1
to	1
exist	1
on	1
the	1
planet.	1
If	1
one	1
asks	1
why	1
our	1
wonderful	1
instruments	1
cannot	1
settle	1
these	1
points,	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
reminded	1
that	1
Mars	1
is	1
never	1
nearer	1
than	1
34,000,000	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
only	1
approaches	1
to	1
this	1
distance	1
once	1
in	1
fifteen	1
or	1
seventeen	1
years.	1
The	1
image	1
of	1
Mars	1
on	1
the	1
photographic	1
negative	1
taken	1
in	1
a	1
big	1
telescope	1
is	1
very	1
small.	1
Astronomers	1
rely	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
on	1
the	1
eye,	1
which	1
is	1
more	1
sensitive	1
than	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
have	1
differences	1
of	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
eye	1
sees,	1
and	1
so	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
controversy.	1
In	1
August,	1
1924,	1
the	1
planet	1
will	1
again	1
be	1
well	1
placed	1
for	1
observation,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
learn	1
more	1
about	1
it.	1
Already	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
much-disputed	1
lines,	1
which	1
people	1
wrongly	1
call	1
"canals,"	1
have	1
been	1
traced	1
on	1
photographs.	1
Astronomers	1
who	1
are	1
sceptical	1
about	1
life	1
on	1
Mars	1
are	1
often	1
not	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
adaptability	1
of	1
life.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
climate	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth,	1
from	1
pole	1
to	1
pole,	1
was	1
semi-tropical	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years.	1
No	1
animal	1
could	1
then	1
endure	1
the	1
least	1
cold,	1
yet	1
now	1
we	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
Arctic	1
plants	1
and	1
animals.	1
If	1
the	1
cold	1
came	1
slowly	1
on	1
Mars,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose,	1
the	1
population	1
could	1
be	1
gradually	1
adapted	1
to	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
whole,	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
advanced	1
life	1
on	1
Mars,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
impossible,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
difficulties	1
of	1
a	1
code	1
of	1
communication,	1
that	1
our	1
"elder	1
brothers"	1
may	1
yet	1
flash	1
across	1
space	1
the	1
solution	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
problems.	1
§	1
2	1
Jupiter	1
and	1
Saturn	1
Next	1
to	1
Mars,	1
going	1
outward	1
from	1
the	1
sun,	1
is	1
Jupiter.	1
Between	1
Mars	1
and	1
Jupiter,	1
however,	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
million	1
miles	1
of	1
space,	1
and	1
the	1
older	1
astronomers	1
wondered	1
why	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
occupied	1
by	1
a	1
planet.	1
We	1
now	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
contains	1
about	1
nine	1
hundred	1
"planetoids,"	1
or	1
small	1
globes	1
of	1
from	1
five	1
to	1
five	1
hundred	1
miles	1
in	1
diameter.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
planet	1
might	1
have	1
burst	1
into	1
these	1
fragments	1
(a	1
theory	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
mathematically	1
satisfactory),	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
material	1
which	1
is	1
scattered	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
bulk	1
of	1
Jupiter	1
from	1
uniting	1
into	1
one	1
globe.	1
For	1
Jupiter	1
is	1
a	1
giant	1
planet,	1
and	1
its	1
gravitational	1
influence	1
must	1
extend	1
far	1
over	1
space.	1
It	1
is	1
1,300	1
times	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
has	1
nine	1
moons,	1
four	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
large,	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
note	1
that	1
the	1
outermost	1
moons	1
of	1
Jupiter	1
and	1
Saturn	1
revolve	1
round	1
these	1
planets	1
in	1
a	1
direction	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
direction	1
taken	1
by	1
moons	1
round	1
planets,	1
and	1
by	1
planets	1
round	1
the	1
sun.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
life	1
on	1
Jupiter.	1
The	1
surface	1
which	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
photographs	1
(Fig.	1
12)	1
is	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
cloud	1
or	1
steam	1
which	1
always	1
envelops	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
planet.	1
It	1
is	1
apparently	1
red-hot.	1
A	1
red	1
tinge	1
is	1
seen	1
sometimes	1
at	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
its	1
cloud-belts,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
red	1
region	1
(the	1
"red	1
spot"),	1
23,000	1
miles	1
in	1
length,	1
has	1
been	1
visible	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
century.	1
There	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
liquid	1
or	1
solid	1
core	1
to	1
the	1
planet,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
seething	1
vapours	1
whirling	1
round	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
once	1
in	1
every	1
ten	1
hours.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
however,	1
different	1
latitudes	1
appear	1
to	1
rotate	1
at	1
different	1
rates.	1
The	1
interior	1
of	1
Jupiter	1
is	1
very	1
hot,	1
but	1
the	1
planet	1
is	1
not	1
self-luminous.	1
The	1
planets	1
Venus	1
and	1
Jupiter	1
shine	1
very	1
brightly,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
light	1
of	1
their	1
own;	1
they	1
reflect	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
Saturn	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
interesting	1
condition.	1
The	1
surface	1
in	1
the	1
photograph	1
(Fig.	1
13)	1
is	1
steam,	1
and	1
Saturn	1
is	1
so	1
far	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
the	1
vaporisation	1
of	1
its	1
oceans	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
due	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
internal	1
heat.	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
hot	1
for	1
water	1
to	1
settle	1
on	1
its	1
surface.	1
Like	1
Jupiter,	1
the	1
great	1
globe	1
turns	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
once	1
in	1
ten	1
hours--a	1
prodigious	1
speed--and	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
swirling,	1
seething	1
mass	1
of	1
metallic	1
vapours	1
and	1
gases.	1
It	1
is	1
instructive	1
to	1
compare	1
Jupiter	1
and	1
Saturn	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
with	1
the	1
sun.	1
They	1
are	1
smaller	1
globes	1
and	1
have	1
cooled	1
down	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
central	1
fire.	1
Saturn	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
object	1
in	1
the	1
telescope	1
because	1
it	1
has	1
ten	1
moons	1
(to	1
include	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
disputed)	1
and	1
a	1
wonderful	1
system	1
of	1
"rings"	1
round	1
it.	1
The	1
so-called	1
rings	1
are	1
a	1
mighty	1
swarm	1
of	1
meteorites--pieces	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
stone	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
sizes,	1
which	1
reflect	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
us.	1
This	1
ocean	1
of	1
matter	1
is	1
some	1
miles	1
deep,	1
and	1
stretches	1
from	1
a	1
few	1
thousand	1
miles	1
from	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
planet	1
to	1
172,000	1
miles	1
out	1
in	1
space.	1
Some	1
astronomers	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
volcanic	1
material	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
planet.	1
Others	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
stuff	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
combined	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
eleventh	1
moon	1
but	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
Saturn	1
itself.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
evidence	1
of	1
life	1
on	1
Saturn.	1
THE	1
MOON	1
Mars	1
and	1
Venus	1
are	1
therefore	1
the	1
only	1
planets,	1
besides	1
the	1
earth,	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
look	1
for	1
life;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Venus,	1
the	1
possibility	1
is	1
very	1
faint.	1
But	1
what	1
about	1
the	1
moons	1
which	1
attend	1
the	1
planets?	1
They	1
range	1
in	1
size	1
from	1
the	1
little	1
ten-miles-wide	1
moons	1
of	1
Mars,	1
to	1
Titan,	1
a	1
moon	1
of	1
Saturn,	1
and	1
Ganymede,	1
a	1
satellite	1
of	1
Jupiter,	1
which	1
are	1
about	1
3,000	1
miles	1
in	1
diameter.	1
May	1
there	1
not	1
be	1
life	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
of	1
these	1
moons?	1
We	1
will	1
take	1
our	1
own	1
moon	1
as	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
the	1
class.	1
A	1
Dead	1
World	1
The	1
moon	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
nearer	1
to	1
us	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
heavenly	1
body	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
remarkable	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
Fig.	1
14	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
photograph,	1
taken	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
largest	1
telescopes,	1
of	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
surface.	1
In	1
a	1
sense	1
such	1
a	1
telescope	1
brings	1
the	1
moon	1
to	1
within	1
about	1
fifty	1
miles	1
of	1
us.	1
We	1
should	1
see	1
a	1
city	1
like	1
London	1
as	1
a	1
dark,	1
sprawling	1
blotch	1
on	1
the	1
globe.	1
We	1
could	1
just	1
detect	1
a	1
Zeppelin	1
or	1
a	1
Diplodocus	1
as	1
a	1
moving	1
speck	1
against	1
the	1
surface.	1
But	1
we	1
find	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
astronomers	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
see	1
signs	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
feeble	1
life	1
or	1
movement	1
on	1
the	1
moon.	1
Professor	1
Pickering	1
thinks	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
trace	1
some	1
volcanic	1
activity.	1
He	1
believes	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
areas	1
of	1
vegetation,	1
probably	1
of	1
a	1
low	1
order,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
soil	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
may	1
retain	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
speaks	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
thin	1
atmosphere,	1
and	1
of	1
occasional	1
light	1
falls	1
of	1
snow.	1
He	1
has	1
succeeded	1
in	1
persuading	1
some	1
careful	1
observers	1
that	1
there	1
probably	1
are	1
slight	1
changes	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
taking	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
moon.	1

The	1
process	1
has	1
gone	1
further	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
distinct	1
tails	1
can	1
now	1
be	1
counted.]	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
point	1
to	1
absence	1
of	1
air	1
on	1
the	1
moon.	1
Even	1
the	1
photographs	1
we	1
reproduce	1
tell	1
the	1
same	1
story.	1
The	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
shadows	1
are	1
all	1
hard	1
and	1
black.	1
If	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
appreciable	1
atmosphere	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
scattered	1
the	1
sun's	1
light	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
edges	1
and	1
produced	1
a	1
gradual	1
shading	1
off	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
This	1
relative	1
absence	1
of	1
air	1
must	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
some	1
surprising	1
effects.	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
sounds	1
on	1
the	1
moon,	1
because	1
sounds	1
are	1
merely	1
air	1
waves.	1
Even	1
a	1
meteor	1
shattering	1
itself	1
to	1
a	1
violent	1
end	1
against	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
noise.	1
Nor	1
would	1
it	1
herald	1
its	1
coming	1
by	1
glowing	1
into	1
a	1
"shooting	1
star,"	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
earth's	1
atmosphere.	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
floating	1
dust,	1
no	1
scent,	1
no	1
twilight,	1
no	1
blue	1
sky,	1
no	1
twinkling	1
of	1
the	1
stars.	1
The	1
sky	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
black	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
will	1
be	1
clearly	1
visible	1
by	1
day	1
as	1
by	1
night.	1
The	1
sun's	1
wonderful	1
corona,	1
which	1
no	1
man	1
on	1
earth,	1
even	1
by	1
seizing	1
every	1
opportunity	1
during	1
eclipses,	1
can	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hours	1
in	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
lifetime,	1
will	1
be	1
visible	1
all	1
day.	1
So	1
will	1
the	1
great	1
red	1
flames	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
Of	1
course,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
life,	1
and	1
no	1
landscape	1
effects	1
and	1
scenery	1
effects	1
due	1
to	1
vegetation.	1
The	1
moon	1
takes	1
approximately	1
twenty-seven	1
of	1
our	1
days	1
to	1
turn	1
once	1
on	1
its	1
axis.	1
So	1
for	1
fourteen	1
days	1
there	1
is	1
continuous	1
night,	1
when	1
the	1
temperature	1
must	1
sink	1
away	1
down	1
towards	1
the	1
absolute	1
cold	1
of	1
space.	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
followed	1
without	1
an	1
instant	1
of	1
twilight	1
by	1
full	1
daylight.	1
For	1
another	1
fourteen	1
days	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays	1
will	1
bear	1
straight	1
down,	1
with	1
no	1
diffusion	1
or	1
absorption	1
of	1
their	1
heat,	1
or	1
light,	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
follow,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
moon's	1
surface	1
must	1
rise	1
enormously.	1
It	1
may	1
not	1
even	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
melting	1
ice.	1
Seeing	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
air	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
check	1
on	1
radiation.	1
The	1
heat	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
gets	1
will	1
radiate	1
away	1
immediately.	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
amongst	1
the	1
coldest	1
places	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
are	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
very	1
high	1
mountains,	1
the	1
points	1
that	1
have	1
reared	1
themselves	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
but	1
farthest	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
sheltering	1
blanket	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
atmosphere.	1
The	1
actual	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
moon's	1
surface	1
by	1
day	1
is	1
a	1
moot	1
point.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
below	1
the	1
freezing-point	1
or	1
above	1
the	1
boiling-point	1
of	1
water.	1
The	1
Mountains	1
of	1
the	1
Moon	1
The	1
lack	1
of	1
air	1
is	1
considered	1
by	1
many	1
astronomers	1
to	1
furnish	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
enormous	1
number	1
of	1
"craters"	1
which	1
pit	1
the	1
moon's	1
surface.	1
There	1
are	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
of	1
these	1
strange	1
rings,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
believed	1
by	1
many	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
spots	1
where	1
very	1
large	1
meteorites,	1
or	1
even	1
planetoids,	1
splashed	1
into	1
the	1
moon	1
when	1
its	1
surface	1
was	1
still	1
soft.	1
Other	1
astronomers	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
gigantic	1
bubbles	1
which	1
were	1
raised	1
in	1
the	1
moon's	1
"skin,"	1
when	1
the	1
globe	1
was	1
still	1
molten,	1
by	1
volcanic	1
gases	1
from	1
below.	1
A	1
few	1
astronomers	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
are,	1
as	1
is	1
popularly	1
supposed,	1
the	1
craters	1
of	1
extinct	1
volcanoes.	1
Our	1
craters,	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
are	1
generally	1
deep	1
cups,	1
whereas	1
these	1
ring-formations	1
on	1
the	1
moon	1
are	1
more	1
like	1
very	1
shallow	1
and	1
broad	1
saucers.	1
Clavius,	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
them,	1
is	1
123	1
miles	1
across	1
the	1
interior,	1
yet	1
its	1
encircling	1
rampart	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
mile	1
high.	1
The	1
mountains	1
on	1
the	1
moon	1
(Fig.	1
16)	1
rise	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
height,	1
and	1
are	1
extraordinarily	1
gaunt	1
and	1
rugged.	1
They	1
are	1
like	1
fountains	1
of	1
lava,	1
rising	1
in	1
places	1
to	1
26,000	1
and	1
27,000	1
feet.	1
The	1
lunar	1
Apennines	1
have	1
three	1
thousand	1
steep	1
and	1
weird	1
peaks.	1
Our	1
terrestrial	1
mountains	1
are	1
continually	1
worn	1
down	1
by	1
frost	1
acting	1
on	1
moisture	1
and	1
by	1
ice	1
and	1
water,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
agencies	1
operating	1
on	1
the	1
moon.	1
Its	1
mountains	1
are	1
comparatively	1
"everlasting	1
hills."	1
The	1
moon	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
us	1
precisely	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
dead	1
world.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
the	1
earth,	1
or	1
any	1
cooling	1
metal	1
globe,	1
will	1
evolve	1
in	1
the	1
remote	1
future.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
ever	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
moon,	1
but	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
cannot	1
have	1
proceeded	1
far	1
in	1
development.	1
At	1
the	1
most	1
we	1
can	1
imagine	1
some	1
strange	1
lowly	1
forms	1
of	1
vegetation	1
lingering	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
in	1
pools	1
of	1
heavy	1
gas,	1
expanding	1
during	1
the	1
blaze	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
long	1
day,	1
and	1
frozen	1
rigid	1
during	1
the	1
long	1
night.	1
METEORS	1
AND	1
COMETS	1
We	1
may	1
conclude	1
our	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
with	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
"shooting	1
stars,"	1
or	1
meteors,	1
and	1
comets.	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
now	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
streak	1
of	1
fire	1
which	1
suddenly	1
lights	1
the	1
sky	1
overhead	1
at	1
night	1
means	1
that	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stone	1
or	1
iron	1
has	1
entered	1
our	1
atmosphere	1
from	1
outer	1
space,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
burned	1
up	1
by	1
friction.	1
It	1
was	1
travelling	1
at,	1
perhaps,	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
At	1
seventy	1
or	1
eighty	1
miles	1
above	1
our	1
heads	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
glow,	1
as	1
at	1
that	1
height	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
thick	1
enough	1
to	1
offer	1
serious	1
friction	1
and	1
raise	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
white	1
heat.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
meteor	1
reached	1
about	1
twenty	1
miles	1
or	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface	1
it	1
was	1
entirely	1
dissipated,	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
in	1
fiery	1
vapour.	1
Millions	1
of	1
Meteorites	1
It	1
is	1
estimated	1
that	1
between	1
ten	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
million	1
meteorites	1
enter	1
our	1
atmosphere	1
and	1
are	1
cremated,	1
every	1
day.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
weigh	1
only	1
an	1
ounce	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
are	1
invisible.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
weigh	1
a	1
ton	1
or	1
more,	1
but	1
even	1
against	1
these	1
large	1
masses	1
the	1
air	1
acts	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
"torpedo-net."	1
They	1
generally	1
burst	1
into	1
fragments	1
and	1
fall	1
without	1
doing	1
damage.	1
It	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
"empty	1
space"	1
is,	1
at	1
least	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
our	1
solar	1
system,	1
full	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
They	1
swarm	1
like	1
fishes	1
in	1
the	1
seas.	1
Like	1
the	1
fishes,	1
moreover,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
either	1
solitary	1
or	1
gregarious.	1
The	1
solitary	1
bit	1
of	1
cosmic	1
rubbish	1
is	1
the	1
meteorite,	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
examined.	1
A	1
"social"	1
group	1
of	1
meteorites	1
is	1
the	1
essential	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
comet.	1
The	1
nucleus,	1
or	1
bright	1
central	1
part,	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
comet	1
(Fig.	1
19)	1
consists	1
of	1
a	1
swarm,	1
sometimes	1
thousands	1
of	1
miles	1
wide,	1
of	1
these	1
pieces	1
of	1
iron	1
or	1
stone.	1
This	1
swarm	1
has	1
come	1
under	1
the	1
sun's	1
gravitational	1
influence,	1
and	1
is	1
forced	1
to	1
travel	1
round	1
it.	1
From	1
some	1
dark	1
region	1
of	1
space	1
it	1
has	1
moved	1
slowly	1
into	1
our	1
system.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
then	1
a	1
comet,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
no	1
tail.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
crowded	1
meteors	1
approach	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
speed	1
increases.	1
They	1
give	1
off	1
fine	1
vapour-like	1
matter	1
and	1
the	1
fierce	1
flood	1
of	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
sweeps	1
this	1
vapour	1
out	1
in	1
an	1
ever-lengthening	1
tail.	1
Whatever	1
way	1
the	1
comet	1
is	1
travelling,	1
the	1
tail	1
always	1
points	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sun.	1
A	1
Great	1
Comet	1
The	1
vapoury	1
tail	1
often	1
grows	1
to	1
an	1
enormous	1
length	1
as	1
the	1
comet	1
approaches	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
great	1
comet	1
of	1
1843	1
had	1
a	1
tail	1
two	1
hundred	1
million	1
miles	1
long.	1
It	1
is,	1
however,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
thinnest	1
vapours	1
imaginable.	1
Twice	1
during	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
the	1
earth	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
a	1
comet,	1
and	1
nothing	1
was	1
felt.	1
The	1
vapours	1
of	1
the	1
tail	1
are,	1
in	1
fact,	1
so	1
attenuated	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
hardly	1
imagine	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
white-hot.	1
They	1
may	1
be	1
lit	1
by	1
some	1
electrical	1
force.	1
However	1
that	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
comet	1
dashes	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
often	1
at	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hundred	1
miles	1
a	1
second,	1
then	1
may	1
pass	1
gradually	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
system	1
once	1
more.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fifty	1
years,	1
before	1
the	1
monarch	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
will	1
summon	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
make	1
its	1
fiery	1
journey	1
round	1
his	1
throne.	1

THE	1
STELLAR	1
UNIVERSE	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
immensity	1
of	1
the	1
Stellar	1
Universe,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
is	1
beyond	1
our	1
apprehension.	1
The	1
sun	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
very	1
ordinary	1
star,	1
perhaps	1
an	1
insignificant	1
one.	1
There	1
are	1
stars	1
enormously	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
sun.	1
One	1
such,	1
Betelgeux,	1
has	1
recently	1
been	1
measured,	1
and	1
its	1
diameter	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
300	1
times	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
Evolution	1
of	1
Stars	1
The	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
similarity	1
between	1
our	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
spectroscope.	1
The	1
elements	1
that	1
we	1
find	1
by	1
its	1
means	1
in	1
the	1
sun	1
are	1
also	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
stars.	1
Matter,	1
says	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
is	1
essentially	1
the	1
same	1
everywhere,	1
in	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
sun,	1
in	1
the	1
comet	1
that	1
visits	1
us	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
in	1
the	1
star	1
whose	1
distance	1
is	1
incalculable,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
clouds	1
of	1
"fire-mist"	1
that	1
we	1
call	1
nebulæ	1
In	1
considering	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
two	1
points	1
clearly	1
in	1
mind.	1
The	1
starting-point,	1
the	1
nebula,	1
is	1
no	1
figment	1
of	1
the	1
scientific	1
imagination.	1
Hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
nebulæbesides	1
even	1
vaster	1
irregular	1
stretches	1
of	1
nebulous	1
matter,	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
But	1
the	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
this	1
stuff	1
into	1
stars	1
are	1
very	1
largely	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
speculation.	1
Possibly	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
line	1
of	1
evolution,	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
theories	1
may	1
be	1
reconciled.	1
And	1
this	1
applies	1
also	1
to	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
stages	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
stars	1
themselves	1
pass	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
extinction.	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
stars	1
has	1
been	1
analysed	1
in	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
into	1
about	1
a	1
dozen	1
classes	1
which	1
generally	1
correspond	1
to	1
stages	1
in	1
their	1
evolution	1
(Fig.	1
21).	1
The	1
Age	1
of	1
Stars	1
In	1
its	1
main	1
lines	1
the	1
spectrum	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
corresponds	1
to	1
its	1
colour,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
roughly	1
group	1
the	1
stars	1
into	1
red,	1
yellow,	1
and	1
white.	1
This	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
increasing	1
temperature,	1
the	1
red	1
stars	1
being	1
the	1
coolest	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
stars	1
the	1
hottest.	1
We	1
might	1
therefore	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
stars	1
are	1
the	1
youngest,	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
grow	1
older	1
and	1
cooler	1
they	1
become	1
yellowish,	1
then	1
red,	1
and	1
finally	1
become	1
invisible--just	1
as	1
a	1
cooling	1
white-hot	1
iron	1
would	1
do.	1
But	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
recent	1
research	1
shows	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
red	1
stars;	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
amongst	1
the	1
oldest	1
stars	1
and	1
some	1
are	1
amongst	1
the	1
youngest.	1
The	1
facts	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
star	1
is	1
first	1
formed	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
hot.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
immense	1
mass	1
of	1
diffuse	1
gas	1
glowing	1
with	1
a	1
dull-red	1
heat.	1
It	1
contracts	1
under	1
the	1
mutual	1
gravitation	1
of	1
its	1
particles,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
so	1
it	1
grows	1
hotter.	1
It	1
acquires	1
a	1
yellowish	1
tinge.	1
As	1
it	1
continues	1
to	1
contract	1
it	1
grows	1
hotter	1
and	1
hotter	1
until	1
its	1
temperature	1
reaches	1
a	1
maximum	1
as	1
a	1
white	1
star.	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
contraction	1
process	1
does	1
not	1
stop,	1
but	1
the	1
heating	1
process	1
does.	1
Further	1
contraction	1
is	1
now	1
accompanied	1
by	1
cooling,	1
and	1
the	1
star	1
goes	1
through	1
its	1
colour	1
changes	1
again,	1
but	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
inverse	1
order.	1
It	1
contracts	1
and	1
cools	1
to	1
yellow	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
red.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
again	1
becomes	1
a	1
red	1
star	1
it	1
is	1
enormously	1
denser	1
and	1
smaller	1
than	1
when	1
it	1
began	1
as	1
a	1
red	1
star.	1
Consequently	1
the	1
red	1
stars	1
are	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
classes	1
called,	1
appropriately,	1
Giants	1
and	1
Dwarfs.	1
This	1
theory,	1
which	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
an	1
American	1
astronomer,	1
H.	1
N.	1
Russell,	1
has	1
been	1
successful	1
in	1
explaining	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
phenomena,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
consequently	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
true.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
the	1
red	1
giant	1
stars	1
were	1
formed	1
has	1
received	1
less	1
satisfactory	1
and	1
precise	1
answers.	1
The	1
most	1
commonly	1
accepted	1
theory	1
is	1
the	1
nebular	1
theory.	1
THE	1
NEBULAR	1
THEORY	1
§	1
2	1
Nebulære	1
dim	1
luminous	1
cloud-like	1
patches	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
more	1
like	1
wisps	1
of	1
smoke	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
than	1
anything	1
else.	1
Both	1
photography	1
and	1
the	1
telescope	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
numerous,	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
being	1
already	1
known	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
being	1
continually	1
added	1
to.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
small.	1
Most	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
immensely	1
large.	1
Actual	1
dimensions	1
cannot	1
be	1
given,	1
because	1
to	1
estimate	1
these	1
we	1
must	1
first	1
know	1
definitely	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
nebulærom	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
distances	1
of	1
some	1
nebulære	1
known	1
approximately,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
therefore	1
form	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
size	1
in	1
these	1
cases.	1
The	1
results	1
are	1
staggering.	1
The	1
mere	1
visible	1
surface	1
of	1
some	1
nebulæs	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
stretch	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
small	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
convenient	1
unit	1
for	1
measuring	1
it.	1
A	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
would	1
require	1
to	1
travel	1
for	1
years	1
to	1
cross	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nebula.	1
Its	1
immensity	1
is	1
inconceivable	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
mind.	1
There	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
types	1
of	1
nebulæand	1
there	1
is	1
evidence	1
suggesting	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
type	1
is	1
only	1
an	1
earlier	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
other;	1
but	1
this	1
again	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
The	1
more	1
primitive	1
nebulæould	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
gas	1
in	1
an	1
extremely	1
rarified	1
form.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
convey	1
an	1
adequate	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
rarity	1
of	1
nebular	1
gases.	1
The	1
residual	1
gases	1
in	1
a	1
vacuum	1
tube	1
are	1
dense	1
by	1
comparison.	1
A	1
cubic	1
inch	1
of	1
air	1
at	1
ordinary	1
pressure	1
would	1
contain	1
more	1
matter	1
than	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
millions	1
of	1
cubic	1
inches	1
of	1
the	1
gases	1
of	1
nebulæThe	1
light	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
faintest	1
stars	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
dimmed	1
by	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
gaseous	1
nebula,	1
although	1
we	1
cannot	1
be	1
sure	1
on	1
this	1
point.	1
The	1
most	1
remarkable	1
physical	1
fact	1
about	1
these	1
gases	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
luminous.	1
Whence	1
they	1
derive	1
their	1
luminosity	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
It	1
hardly	1
seems	1
possible	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
extremely	1
thin	1
gases	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
terrific	1
cold	1
of	1
space	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
hot	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
luminous	1
and	1
can	1
retain	1
their	1
heat	1
and	1
their	1
luminosity	1
indefinitely.	1
A	1
cold	1
luminosity	1
due	1
to	1
electrification,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
aurora	1
borealis,	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
fit	1
the	1
case	1
better.	1
Now	1
the	1
nebular	1
theory	1
is	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
great	1
"fire-mists,"	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
described,	1
stars	1
are	1
born.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
gravitation	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
main	1
force	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
a	1
nebula,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
supposed	1
that	1
under	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
gravity	1
the	1
far-flung	1
"fire-mists"	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
condense	1
round	1
centres	1
of	1
greatest	1
density,	1
heat	1
being	1
evolved	1
in	1
the	1
process.	1
Of	1
course	1
the	1
condensation	1
would	1
be	1
enormously	1
slow,	1
although	1
the	1
sudden	1
irruption	1
of	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
meteors	1
or	1
some	1
solid	1
body	1
might	1
hasten	1
matters	1
greatly	1
by	1
providing	1
large,	1
ready-made	1
centres	1
of	1
condensation.	1
Spiral	1
NebulæIt	1
is	1
then	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
contracting	1
mass	1
of	1
gas	1
would	1
begin	1
to	1
rotate	1
and	1
to	1
throw	1
off	1
gigantic	1
streamers,	1
which	1
would	1
in	1
their	1
turn	1
form	1
centres	1
of	1
condensation.	1
The	1
whole	1
structure	1
would	1
thus	1
form	1
a	1
spiral,	1
having	1
a	1
dense	1
region	1
at	1
its	1
centre	1
and	1
knots	1
or	1
lumps	1
of	1
condensed	1
matter	1
along	1
its	1
spiral	1
arms.	1
Besides	1
the	1
formless	1
gaseous	1
nebulæhere	1
are	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
"spiral"	1
nebulæuch	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
They	1
are	1
at	1
all	1
stages	1
of	1
development,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
visible	1
to	1
us	1
at	1
all	1
angles--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
face	1
directly	1
towards	1
us,	1
others	1
are	1
edge	1
on,	1
and	1
some	1
are	1
in	1
intermediate	1
positions.	1
It	1
appears,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
here	1
a	1
striking	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
nebular	1
hypothesis.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
fast.	1
There	1
is	1
much	1
controversy	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
these	1
spiral	1
nebulæSome	1
eminent	1
astronomers	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
other	1
stellar	1
universes,	1
comparable	1
in	1
size	1
with	1
our	1
own.	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
they	1
are	1
vast	1
structures,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
represent	1
stars	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
condensation,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
giving	1
birth	1
to	1
huge	1
agglomerations	1
of	1
stars--to	1
star	1
clusters	1
at	1
least.	1
These	1
vast	1
and	1
enigmatic	1
objects	1
do	1
not	1
throw	1
much	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
solar	1
system.	1
The	1
nebular	1
hypothesis,	1
which	1
was	1
invented	1
by	1
Laplace	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
our	1
solar	1
system,	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
met	1
with	1
universal	1
acceptance.	1
The	1
explanation	1
offers	1
grave	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
best	1
while	1
the	1
subject	1
is	1
still	1
being	1
closely	1
investigated,	1
to	1
hold	1
all	1
opinions	1
with	1
reserve.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
taken	1
as	1
probable,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
has	1
developed	1
from	1
masses	1
of	1
incandescent	1
gas.	1

THE	1
BIRTH	1
AND	1
DEATH	1
OF	1
STARS	1
§	1
3	1
Variable,	1
New,	1
and	1
Dark	1
Stars:	1
Dying	1
Suns	1
Many	1
astronomers	1
believe	1
that	1
in	1
"variable	1
stars"	1
we	1
have	1
another	1
star,	1
following	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
dullest	1
red	1
star,	1
in	1
the	1
dying	1
of	1
suns.	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
these	1
stars	1
varies	1
periodically	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
days,	1
weeks,	1
or	1
years.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
speculate	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
slowly	1
dying	1
suns,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
molten	1
interior	1
periodically	1
bursts	1
through	1
the	1
shell	1
of	1
thick	1
vapours	1
that	1
is	1
gathering	1
round	1
them.	1
What	1
we	1
saw	1
about	1
our	1
sun	1
seems	1
to	1
point	1
to	1
some	1
such	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
That	1
is,	1
however,	1
not	1
the	1
received	1
opinion	1
about	1
variable	1
stars.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
stars	1
which	1
periodically	1
pass	1
through	1
a	1
great	1
swarm	1
of	1
meteors	1
or	1
a	1
region	1
of	1
space	1
that	1
is	1
rich	1
in	1
cosmic	1
dust	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
when,	1
of	1
course,	1
a	1
great	1
illumination	1
would	1
take	1
place.	1
One	1
class	1
of	1
these	1
variable	1
stars,	1
which	1
takes	1
its	1
name	1
from	1
the	1
star	1
Algol,	1
is	1
of	1
special	1
interest.	1
Every	1
third	1
night	1
Algol	1
has	1
its	1
light	1
reduced	1
for	1
several	1
hours.	1
Modern	1
astronomy	1
has	1
discovered	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
there	1
are	1
really	1
two	1
stars,	1
circulating	1
round	1
a	1
common	1
centre,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
third	1
night	1
the	1
fainter	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
comes	1
directly	1
between	1
us	1
and	1
its	1
companion	1
and	1
causes	1
an	1
"eclipse."	1
This	1
was	1
until	1
recently	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
dead	1
star	1
revealed	1
itself	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
passing	1
before	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
another	1
star.	1
But	1
astronomers	1
have	1
in	1
recent	1
years	1
invented	1
something,	1
the	1
"selenium-cell,"	1
which	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
sensitive	1
than	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
the	1
supposed	1
dead	1
star	1
registers	1
itself	1
as	1
very	1
much	1
alive.	1
Algol	1
is,	1
however,	1
interesting	1
in	1
another	1
way.	1
The	1
pair	1
of	1
stars	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
discovered	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
hundreds	1
of	1
trillions	1
of	1
miles	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
yet	1
we	1
know	1
their	1
masses	1
and	1
their	1
distances	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
Death	1
and	1
Birth	1
of	1
Stars	1
We	1
have	1
no	1
positive	1
knowledge	1
of	1
dead	1
stars;	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
surprising	1
when	1
we	1
reflect	1
that	1
a	1
dead	1
star	1
means	1
an	1
invisible	1
star!	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
individual	1
stars	1
tending	1
toward	1
death,	1
when	1
we	1
behold	1
a	1
vast	1
population	1
of	1
all	1
conceivable	1
ages,	1
we	1
presume	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
already	1
dead.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
is	1
"running	1
down."	1
Some	1
writers	1
have	1
maintained	1
this,	1
but	1
their	1
argument	1
implies	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
universe	1
than	1
we	1
actually	1
do.	1
The	1
scientific	1
man	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
finite	1
or	1
infinite,	1
temporal	1
or	1
eternal;	1
and	1
he	1
declines	1
to	1
speculate	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
facts	1
to	1
guide	1
him.	1
He	1
knows	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
gaseous	1
nebulæromise	1
myriads	1
of	1
worlds	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
and	1
he	1
concedes	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
new	1
nebulæay	1
be	1
forming	1
in	1
the	1
ether	1
of	1
space.	1
The	1
last,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
interesting,	1
subject	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
notice	1
is	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
a	1
"new	1
star."	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
astronomers	1
now	1
announce	1
every	1
few	1
years;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
far	1
more	1
portentous	1
event	1
than	1
the	1
reader	1
imagines	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
reported	1
in	1
his	1
daily	1
paper.	1
The	1
story	1
is	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
all	1
cases.	1
We	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
star	1
appeared	1
in	1
1901,	1
but	1
you	1
begin	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
magnitude	1
of	1
the	1
event	1
when	1
you	1
learn	1
that	1
the	1
distant	1
"blaze"	1
had	1
really	1
occurred	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Luther!	1
The	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
conflagration	1
had	1
been	1
speeding	1
toward	1
us	1
across	1
space	1
at	1
186,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second,	1
yet	1
it	1
has	1
taken	1
nearly	1
three	1
centuries	1
to	1
reach	1
us.	1
To	1
be	1
visible	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
us	1
at	1
that	1
distance	1
the	1
fiery	1
outbreak	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
stupendous.	1
If	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
petroleum	1
ten	1
times	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
suddenly	1
fired	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
distance.	1
The	1
new	1
star	1
had	1
increased	1
its	1
light	1
many	1
hundredfold	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
considerable	1
fascination	1
about	1
the	1
speculation	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
world,	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
renewing	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
What	1
happens	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
sky	1
where	1
no	1
star,	1
or	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
faint	1
star,	1
had	1
been	1
registered	1
on	1
our	1
charts,	1
we	1
almost	1
suddenly	1
perceive	1
a	1
bright	1
star.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
it	1
may	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
brilliancy.	1
By	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
we	1
learn	1
that	1
this	1
distant	1
blaze	1
means	1
a	1
prodigious	1
outpour	1
of	1
white-hot	1
hydrogen	1
at	1
hundreds	1
of	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
But	1
the	1
star	1
sinks	1
again	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
months,	1
and	1
we	1
then	1
find	1
a	1
nebula	1
round	1
it	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
a	1
dead	1
or	1
dying	1
sun	1
has	1
somehow	1
been	1
reconverted	1
in	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
part	1
into	1
a	1
nebula.	1
A	1
few	1
astronomers	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
partially	1
collided	1
with	1
another	1
star,	1
or	1
approached	1
too	1
closely	1
to	1
another,	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
we	1
described	1
on	1
an	1
earlier	1
page.	1
The	1
general	1
opinion	1
now	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
faint	1
or	1
dead	1
star	1
had	1
rushed	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
regions	1
of	1
space	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
immense	1
stretches	1
of	1
nebulous	1
matter,	1
and	1
been	1
(at	1
least	1
in	1
part)	1
vaporised	1
by	1
the	1
friction.	1
But	1
the	1
difficulties	1
are	1
considerable,	1
and	1
some	1
astronomers	1
prefer	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
blazing	1
star	1
may	1
merely	1
have	1
lit	1
up	1
a	1
dark	1
nebula	1
which	1
already	1
existed.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
problems	1
on	1
which	1
speculation	1
is	1
most	1
tempting	1
but	1
positive	1
knowledge	1
is	1
still	1
very	1
incomplete.	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
content,	1
even	1
proud,	1
that	1
already	1
we	1
can	1
take	1
a	1
conflagration	1
that	1
has	1
occurred	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
trillion	1
miles	1
away	1
and	1
analyse	1
it	1
positively	1
into	1
an	1
outflame	1
of	1
glowing	1
hydrogen	1
gas	1
at	1
so	1
many	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
THE	1
SHAPE	1
OF	1
OUR	1
UNIVERSE	1
§	1
4	1
Our	1
Universe	1
a	1
Spiral	1
Nebula	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
our	1
universe,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
its	1
dimensions?	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
tremendous	1
question	1
to	1
ask.	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
asking	1
an	1
intelligent	1
insect,	1
living	1
on	1
a	1
single	1
leaf	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
Brazilian	1
forest,	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
shape	1
and	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
Yet	1
man's	1
ingenuity	1
has	1
proved	1
equal	1
to	1
giving	1
an	1
answer	1
even	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
method	1
exactly	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
insect.	1
Suppose,	1
for	1
instance,	1
that	1
the	1
forest	1
was	1
shaped	1
as	1
an	1
elongated	1
oval,	1
and	1
the	1
insect	1
lived	1
on	1
a	1
tree	1
near	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
oval.	1
If	1
the	1
trees	1
were	1
approximately	1
equally	1
spaced	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
they	1
would	1
appear	1
much	1
denser	1
along	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
oval	1
than	1
across	1
its	1
width.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
simple	1
consideration	1
that	1
has	1
guided	1
astronomers	1
in	1
determining	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
our	1
stellar	1
universe.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
direction	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
stars	1
appear	1
denser	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
directions	1
at	1
right	1
angles	1
to	1
it.	1
That	1
direction	1
is	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
look	1
towards	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
If	1
we	1
count	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
stars	1
visible	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
heavens,	1
we	1
find	1
they	1
become	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
numerous	1
as	1
we	1
approach	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
As	1
we	1
go	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
from	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
the	1
stars	1
thin	1
out	1
until	1
they	1
reach	1
a	1
maximum	1
sparseness	1
in	1
directions	1
at	1
right	1
angles	1
to	1
the	1
plane	1
of	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
We	1
may	1
consider	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
to	1
form,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
the	1
equator	1
of	1
our	1
system,	1
and	1
the	1
line	1
at	1
right	1
angles	1
to	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
north	1
and	1
south	1
poles.	1
Our	1
system,	1
in	1
fact,	1
is	1
shaped	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
lens,	1
and	1
our	1
sun	1
is	1
situated	1
near	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
this	1
lens.	1
In	1
the	1
remoter	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
lens,	1
near	1
its	1
edge,	1
or	1
possibly	1
outside	1
it	1
altogether,	1
lies	1
the	1
great	1
series	1
of	1
star	1
clouds	1
which	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way.	1
All	1
the	1
stars	1
are	1
in	1
motion	1
within	1
this	1
system,	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
remarkable	1
discovery	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
that	1
these	1
motions	1
are	1
not	1
entirely	1
random.	1
The	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
whose	1
motions	1
can	1
be	1
measured	1
fall	1
into	1
two	1
groups	1
drifting	1
past	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
opposite	1
directions.	1
The	1
velocity	1
of	1
one	1
stream	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
about	1
twenty-five	1
miles	1
per	1
second.	1
The	1
stars	1
forming	1
these	1
two	1
groups	1
are	1
thoroughly	1
well	1
mixed;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
inner	1
stream	1
going	1
one	1
way	1
and	1
an	1
outer	1
stream	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
as	1
many	1
stars	1
going	1
one	1
way	1
as	1
the	1
other.	1
For	1
every	1
two	1
stars	1
in	1
one	1
stream	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
Now,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
some	1
eminent	1
astronomers	1
hold	1
that	1
the	1
spiral	1
nebulære	1
universes	1
like	1
our	1
own,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
photographs	1
(Figs.	1
25	1
and	1
26)	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
these	1
spirals	1
present	1
features	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
said	1
about	1
our	1
system,	1
are	1
very	1
remarkable.	1
The	1
nebula	1
in	1
Coma	1
Berenices	1
is	1
a	1
spiral	1
edge-on	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
precisely	1
the	1
lens-shaped	1
middle	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
flattened	1
shape	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
system.	1
The	1
nebula	1
in	1
Canes	1
Venatici	1
is	1
a	1
spiral	1
facing	1
towards	1
us,	1
and	1
its	1
shape	1
irresistibly	1
suggests	1
motions	1
along	1
the	1
spiral	1
arms.	1
This	1
motion,	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
towards	1
or	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
central,	1
lens-shaped	1
portion,	1
would	1
cause	1
a	1
double	1
streaming	1
motion	1
in	1
that	1
central	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
system.	1
Again,	1
and	1
altogether	1
apart	1
from	1
these	1
considerations,	1
there	1
are	1
good	1
reasons	1
for	1
supposing	1
our	1
Milky	1
Way	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
double-armed	1
spiral	1
structure.	1
And	1
the	1
great	1
patches	1
of	1
dark	1
absorbing	1
matter	1
which	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
(see	1
Fig.	1
22)	1
would	1
give	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
mottled	1
appearance	1
we	1
notice	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
(which	1
we	1
see	1
edge-on)	1
of	1
the	1
nebula	1
in	1
Coma	1
Berenices.	1
The	1
hypothesis,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
our	1
universe	1
is	1
a	1
spiral	1
nebula	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
it.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
accepted	1
it	1
greatly	1
increases	1
our	1
estimate	1
of	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
material	1
universe.	1
For	1
our	1
central,	1
lens-shaped	1
system	1
is	1
calculated	1
to	1
extend	1
towards	1
the	1
Milky	1
Way	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
times	1
a	1
million	1
million	1
miles,	1
and	1
about	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
this	1
distance	1
towards	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
called	1
the	1
poles.	1
If,	1
as	1
we	1
suppose,	1
each	1
spiral	1
nebula	1
is	1
an	1
independent	1
stellar	1
universe	1
comparable	1
in	1
size	1
with	1
our	1
own,	1
then,	1
since	1
there	1
are	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
spiral	1
nebulæwe	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
material	1
universe	1
is	1
indeed	1
beyond	1
our	1
comprehension.	1

that	1
engage	1

ASTRONOMICAL	1
INSTRUMENTS	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
Telescope	1
The	1
instruments	1
used	1
in	1
modern	1
astronomy	1
are	1
amongst	1
the	1
finest	1
triumphs	1
of	1
mechanical	1
skill	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
In	1
a	1
great	1
modern	1
observatory	1
the	1
different	1
instruments	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
counted	1
by	1
the	1
score,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
which	1
stand	1
out	1
pre-eminent	1
as	1
the	1
fundamental	1
instruments	1
of	1
modern	1
astronomy.	1
These	1
instruments	1
are	1
the	1
telescope	1
and	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
and	1
without	1
them	1
astronomy,	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
it,	1
could	1
not	1
exist.	1
There	1
is	1
still	1
some	1
dispute	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
telescope	1
was	1
constructed;	1
as	1
an	1
astronomical	1
instrument,	1
however,	1
it	1
dates	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Italian	1
scientist	1
Galileo,	1
who,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
imperfect	1
telescope	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
invention,	1
first	1
observed	1
the	1
spots	1
on	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and	1
the	1
chief	1
four	1
satellites	1
of	1
Jupiter.	1
A	1
good	1
pair	1
of	1
modern	1
binoculars	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
this	1
early	1
instrument	1
of	1
Galileo's,	1
and	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
telescope	1
construction,	1
from	1
that	1
primitive	1
instrument	1
to	1
the	1
modern	1
giant	1
recently	1
erected	1
on	1
Mount	1
Wilson,	1
California,	1
is	1
an	1
exciting	1
chapter	1
in	1
human	1
progress.	1
But	1
the	1
early	1
instruments	1
have	1
only	1
an	1
historic	1
interest:	1
the	1
era	1
of	1
modern	1
telescopes	1
begins	1
in	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century.	1
During	1
the	1
last	1
century	1
telescope	1
construction	1
underwent	1
an	1
unprecedented	1
development.	1
An	1
immense	1
amount	1
of	1
interest	1
was	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
large	1
telescopes,	1
and	1
the	1
different	1
countries	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
entered	1
on	1
an	1
exciting	1
race	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
possible	1
instruments.	1
Besides	1
this	1
rivalry	1
of	1
different	1
countries	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rivalry	1
of	1
methods.	1
The	1
telescope	1
developed	1
along	1
two	1
different	1
lines,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
types	1
has	1
its	1
partisans	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day.	1
These	1
types	1
are	1
known	1
as	1
_refractors_	1
and	1
_reflectors_,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
mention,	1
briefly,	1
the	1
principles	1
employed	1
in	1
each.	1
The	1
_refractor_	1
is	1
the	1
ordinary,	1
familiar	1
type	1
of	1
telescope.	1
It	1
consists,	1
essentially,	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
lens	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
tube,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
lens,	1
called	1
the	1
eye-piece,	1
at	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
function	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
lens	1
is	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
gigantic	1
eye.	1
It	1
collects	1
a	1
large	1
amount	1
of	1
light,	1
an	1
amount	1
proportional	1
to	1
its	1
size,	1
and	1
brings	1
this	1
light	1
to	1
a	1
focus	1
within	1
the	1
tube	1
of	1
the	1
telescope.	1
It	1
thus	1
produces	1
a	1
small	1
but	1
bright	1
image,	1
and	1
the	1
eye-piece	1
magnifies	1
this	1
image.	1
In	1
the	1
_reflector_,	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
lens	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
tube,	1
a	1
large	1
mirror	1
is	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
bottom.	1
This	1
mirror	1
is	1
so	1
shaped	1
as	1
to	1
reflect	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
falls	1
on	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
focus,	1
whence	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
again	1
led	1
to	1
an	1
eye-piece.	1
Thus	1
the	1
refractor	1
and	1
the	1
reflector	1
differ	1
chiefly	1
in	1
their	1
manner	1
of	1
gathering	1
light.	1
The	1
powerfulness	1
of	1
the	1
telescope	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
light-gatherer.	1
A	1
telescope	1
with	1
a	1
lens	1
four	1
inches	1
in	1
diameter	1
is	1
four	1
times	1
as	1
powerful	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
a	1
lens	1
two	1
inches	1
in	1
diameter,	1
for	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
light	1
gathered	1
obviously	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
_area_	1
of	1
the	1
lens,	1
and	1
the	1
area	1
varies	1
as	1
the	1
_square_	1
of	1
the	1
diameter.	1
The	1
largest	1
telescopes	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
existence	1
are	1
_reflectors_.	1
It	1
is	1
much	1
easier	1
to	1
construct	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
mirror	1
than	1
to	1
construct	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
lens;	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
cheaper.	1
A	1
mirror	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
order	1
than	1
is	1
a	1
lens,	1
however,	1
and	1
any	1
irregularity	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
mirror	1
produces	1
a	1
greater	1
distorting	1
effect	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
lens.	1
A	1
refractor	1
is	1
also	1
more	1
convenient	1
to	1
handle	1
than	1
is	1
a	1
reflector.	1
For	1
these	1
reasons	1
great	1
refractors	1
are	1
still	1
made,	1
but	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
great	1
Yerkes'	1
refractor,	1
is	1
much	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
greatest	1
reflector,	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
Mount	1
Wilson,	1
California.	1
The	1
lens	1
of	1
the	1
Yerkes'	1
refractor	1
measures	1
three	1
feet	1
four	1
inches	1
in	1
diameter,	1
whereas	1
the	1
Mount	1
Wilson	1
reflector	1
has	1
a	1
diameter	1
of	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
eight	1
feet	1
four	1
inches.	1

MODERN	1
DIRECT-READING	1
SPECTROSCOPE	1
(_By	1
A.	1
Hilger,	1
Ltd._)	1
The	1
light	1
is	1
brought	1
through	1
one	1
telescope,	1
is	1
split	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
prism,	1
and	1
the	1
resulting	1
spectrum	1
is	1
observed	1
through	1
the	1
other	1
telescope.]	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
device	1
whereby	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
these	1
giant	1
instruments,	1
great	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
can	1
be	1
still	1
further	1
heightened.	1
That	1
device	1
is	1
the	1
simple	1
one	1
of	1
allowing	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
eye.	1
Nowadays	1
an	1
astronomer	1
seldom	1
spends	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
his	1
eye	1
glued	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
telescope.	1
He	1
puts	1
a	1
photographic	1
plate	1
there.	1
The	1
photographic	1
plate	1
has	1
this	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
eye,	1
that	1
it	1
builds	1
up	1
impressions.	1
However	1
long	1
we	1
stare	1
at	1
an	1
object	1
too	1
faint	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
see	1
it.	1
With	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate,	1
however,	1
faint	1
impressions	1
go	1
on	1
accumulating.	1
As	1
hour	1
after	1
hour	1
passes,	1
the	1
star	1
which	1
was	1
too	1
faint	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
perceptible	1
impression	1
on	1
the	1
plate	1
goes	1
on	1
affecting	1
it	1
until	1
finally	1
it	1
makes	1
an	1
impression	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
visible.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate	1
reveals	1
to	1
us	1
phenomena	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
seen	1
even	1
through	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
telescopes.	1
Telescopes	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
discussing,	1
telescopes	1
for	1
exploring	1
the	1
heavens,	1
are	1
mounted	1
_equatorially_;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
they	1
are	1
mounted	1
on	1
an	1
inclined	1
pillar	1
parallel	1
to	1
the	1
axis	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
so	1
that,	1
by	1
rotating	1
round	1
this	1
pillar,	1
the	1
telescope	1
is	1
enabled	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
apparent	1
motion	1
of	1
a	1
star	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
This	1
motion	1
is	1
effected	1
by	1
clock-work,	1
so	1
that,	1
once	1
adjusted	1
on	1
a	1
star,	1
and	1
the	1
clock-work	1
started,	1
the	1
telescope	1
remains	1
adjusted	1
on	1
that	1
star	1
for	1
any	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
that	1
is	1
desired.	1
But	1
a	1
great	1
official	1
observatory,	1
such	1
as	1
Greenwich	1
Observatory	1
or	1
the	1
Observatory	1
at	1
Paris,	1
also	1
has	1
_transit_	1
instruments,	1
or	1
telescopes	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
equatorials	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
same	1
facility	1
of	1
movement,	1
but	1
which,	1
by	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
exquisite	1
refinements,	1
are	1
more	1
adapted	1
to	1
accurate	1
measurements.	1
It	1
is	1
these	1
instruments	1
which	1
are	1
chiefly	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
compilation	1
of	1
the	1
_Nautical	1
Almanac_.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
follow	1
the	1
apparent	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
stars.	1
Stars	1
are	1
allowed	1
to	1
drift	1
across	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
vision,	1
and	1
as	1
each	1
star	1
crosses	1
a	1
small	1
group	1
of	1
parallel	1
wires	1
in	1
the	1
eye-piece	1
its	1
precise	1
time	1
of	1
passage	1
is	1
recorded.	1
Owing	1
to	1
their	1
relative	1
fixity	1
of	1
position	1
these	1
instruments	1
can	1
be	1
constructed	1
to	1
record	1
the	1
_positions_	1
of	1
stars	1
with	1
much	1
greater	1
accuracy	1
than	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
general	1
and	1
flexible	1
mounting	1
of	1
equatorials.	1
The	1
recording	1
of	1
transit	1
is	1
comparatively	1
dry	1
work;	1
the	1
spectacular	1
element	1
is	1
entirely	1
absent;	1
stars	1
are	1
treated	1
merely	1
as	1
mathematical	1
points.	1
But	1
these	1
observations	1
furnish	1
the	1
very	1
basis	1
of	1
modern	1
mathematical	1
astronomy,	1
and	1
without	1
them	1
such	1
publications	1
as	1
the	1
_Nautical	1
Almanac_	1
and	1
the	1
_Connaissance	1
du	1
Temps_	1
would	1
be	1
robbed	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
importance.	1
§	1
2	1
The	1
Spectroscope	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
learnt	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
spectroscope,	1
the	1
instrument	1
which,	1
by	1
making	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
learn	1
the	1
actual	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
stars,	1
has	1
added	1
a	1
vast	1
new	1
domain	1
to	1
astronomy.	1
In	1
the	1
simplest	1
form	1
of	1
this	1
instrument	1
the	1
analysing	1
portion	1
consists	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
prism.	1
Unless	1
the	1
prism	1
is	1
very	1
large,	1
however,	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
degree	1
of	1
dispersion	1
is	1
obtained.	1
It	1
is	1
obviously	1
desirable,	1
for	1
accurate	1
analytical	1
work,	1
that	1
the	1
dispersion--that	1
is,	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
spectrum--should	1
be	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
possible.	1
The	1
dispersion	1
can	1
be	1
increased	1
by	1
using	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
prisms,	1
the	1
light	1
emerging	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
prism,	1
entering	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
each	1
prism	1
produces	1
its	1
own	1
dispersive	1
effect	1
and,	1
when	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
prisms	1
are	1
employed,	1
the	1
final	1
dispersion	1
is	1
considerable.	1
A	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
light	1
is	1
absorbed	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
however,	1
so	1
that	1
unless	1
our	1
primary	1
source	1
of	1
light	1
is	1
very	1
strong,	1
the	1
final	1
spectrum	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
feeble	1
and	1
hard	1
to	1
decipher.	1
Another	1
way	1
of	1
obtaining	1
considerable	1
dispersion	1
is	1
by	1
using	1
a	1
_diffraction	1
grating_	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
prism.	1
This	1
consists	1
essentially	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
glass	1
on	1
which	1
lines	1
are	1
ruled	1
by	1
a	1
diamond	1
point.	1
When	1
the	1
lines	1
are	1
sufficiently	1
close	1
together	1
they	1
split	1
up	1
light	1
falling	1
on	1
them	1
into	1
its	1
constituents	1
and	1
produce	1
a	1
spectrum.	1
The	1
modern	1
diffraction	1
grating	1
is	1
a	1
truly	1
wonderful	1
piece	1
of	1
work.	1
It	1
contains	1
several	1
thousands	1
of	1
lines	1
to	1
the	1
inch,	1
and	1
these	1
lines	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
spaced	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
accuracy.	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
instrument,	1
again,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
considerable	1
loss	1
of	1
light.	1
We	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
every	1
substance	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
distinctive	1
spectrum,	1
and	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
thought	1
that,	1
when	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
spectra	1
of	1
different	1
substances	1
has	1
been	1
prepared,	1
spectrum	1
analysis	1
would	1
become	1
perfectly	1
straightforward.	1
In	1
practice,	1
however,	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
simple.	1
The	1
spectrum	1
emitted	1
by	1
a	1
substance	1
is	1
influenced	1
by	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
conditions.	1
The	1
pressure,	1
the	1
temperature,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
we	1
are	1
observing,	1
all	1
make	1
a	1
difference,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
laborious	1
tasks	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
spectroscopist	1
is	1
to	1
disentangle	1
these	1
effects	1
from	1
one	1
another.	1
Simple	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
its	1
broad	1
outlines,	1
spectroscopy	1
is,	1
in	1
reality,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
intricate	1
branches	1
of	1
modern	1
science.	1

§	1
1	1
The	1
Evolution-idea	1
is	1
a	1
master-key	1
that	1
opens	1
many	1
doors.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
luminous	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
throwing	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
upon	1
the	1
present.	1
Everything	1
is	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
antiquity,	1
with	1
a	1
history	1
behind	1
it--a	1
_natural	1
history_,	1
which	1
enables	1
us	1
to	1
understand	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
how	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
is.	1
We	1
cannot	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
"understand	1
in	1
some	1
measure,"	1
for	1
while	1
the	1
_fact_	1
of	1
evolution	1
is	1
certain,	1
we	1
are	1
only	1
beginning	1
to	1
discern	1
the	1
_factors_	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
work.	1
The	1
evolution-idea	1
is	1
very	1
old,	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Greek	1
philosophers,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
modern	1
times	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
an	1
essential	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
mental	1
equipment.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
an	1
everyday	1
intellectual	1
tool.	1
It	1
was	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
applied	1
to	1
plants	1
and	1
animals;	1
it	1
was	1
extended	1
from	1
these	1
to	1
man	1
himself;	1
it	1
spread	1
to	1
language,	1
to	1
folk-ways,	1
to	1
institutions.	1
Within	1
recent	1
years	1
the	1
evolution-idea	1
has	1
been	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
chemical	1
elements,	1
for	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
uranium	1
may	1
change	1
into	1
radium,	1
that	1
radium	1
may	1
produce	1
helium,	1
and	1
that	1
lead	1
is	1
the	1
final	1
stable	1
result	1
when	1
the	1
changes	1
of	1
uranium	1
are	1
complete.	1
Perhaps	1
all	1
the	1
elements	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
an	1
inorganic	1
evolution.	1
Not	1
less	1
important	1
is	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
evolution-idea	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
within	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
without.	1
For	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
bodies	1
and	1
brains	1
is	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
feelings	1
and	1
emotions,	1
ideas	1
and	1
imagination.	1
Organic	1
evolution	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
power	1
or	1
a	1
principle;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
process--a	1
process	1
of	1
becoming.	1
It	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
present-day	1
animals	1
and	1
plants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
subtle	1
inter-relations	1
between	1
them	1
have	1
arisen	1
in	1
a	1
natural	1
knowable	1
way	1
from	1
a	1
preceding	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
somewhat	1
simpler,	1
and	1
that	1
again	1
from	1
forms	1
and	1
inter-relations	1
simpler	1
still,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
backwards	1
and	1
backwards	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
till	1
we	1
lose	1
all	1
clues	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
mist	1
that	1
hangs	1
over	1
life's	1
beginnings.	1
Our	1
solar	1
system	1
was	1
once	1
represented	1
by	1
a	1
nebula	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
planets.	1
But	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
_the	1
same	1
material	1
throughout_	1
that	1
has	1
changed	1
in	1
its	1
distribution	1
and	1
forms,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
clearer	1
to	1
use	1
some	1
word	1
like	1
genesis.	1
Similarly,	1
our	1
human	1
institutions	1
were	1
once	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
now,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
government	1
or	1
of	1

But	1
Man	1
works	1
with	1
a	1

with	1
ideas	1

ideals	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
controlling	1
his	1
actions	1
and	1
guiding	1
his	1
achievements,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
probably	1
clearer	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
word	1
history	1
for	1
all	1
processes	1
of	1
social	1

Now	1
between	1
the	1
genesis	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1

and	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
civilisation	1
there	1
comes	1
the	1
vast	1
process	1
of	1
organic	1
evolution.	1
The	1
word	1
development	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
for	1
the	1
becoming	1
of	1
the	1
individual,	1
the	1
chick	1
out	1
of	1

for	1

Organic	1
evolution	1
is	1
a	1
continuous	1
natural	1
process	1
of	1
racial	1
change,	1
by	1
successive	1
steps	1
in	1
a	1
definite	1
direction,	1
whereby	1
distinctively	1
new	1
individualities	1
arise,	1
take	1
root,	1
and	1
flourish,	1
sometimes	1
alongside	1
of,	1
and	1
sometimes,	1
sooner	1
or	1
later,	1
in	1
place	1
of,	1
the	1
originative	1
stock.	1
Our	1
domesticated	1
breeds	1
of	1
pigeons	1
and	1
poultry	1
are	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
evolutionary	1
change	1
whose	1
origins	1
are	1
still	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
Rock	1
Dove	1
and	1
the	1
Jungle	1
Fowl;	1
but	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
in	1
Wild	1
Nature	1
the	1
ancestral	1

forms	1
are	1
long	1
since	1
extinct,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
they	1
are	1
unknown.	1
Evolution	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
process	1
of	1
coming	1
and	1
going,	1
appearing	1
and	1
disappearing,	1
a	1
long-drawn-out	1
sublime	1

The	1
Beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Earth	1
When	1
we	1
speak	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
science	1
we	1
cannot	1
say	1
"In	1
the	1
beginning,"	1
for	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
and	1
cannot	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
condition	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
arise	1
from	1
something	1
that	1
went	1
before.	1
But	1
we	1
may	1
qualify	1
the	1
phrase,	1
and	1
legitimately	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
within	1
the	1
solar	1
system.	1
If	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
this	1
inquiry	1
is	1
to	1
trace	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
planets	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
nebula	1
we	1
reach	1
only	1
a	1
relative	1
beginning.	1
The	1
nebula	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
for.	1
And	1
even	1
before	1
matter	1
there	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
pre-material	1
world.	1
If	1
we	1
say,	1
as	1
was	1
said	1
long	1
ago,	1
"In	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
Mind,"	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
expressing	1
or	1
trying	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
great	1
truth,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
gone	1
BEYOND	1
SCIENCE.	1
The	1
Nebular	1
Hypothesis	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
grandest	1
pictures	1
that	1
the	1
scientific	1
mind	1
has	1
ever	1
thrown	1
upon	1
the	1
screen	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Nebular	1
Hypothesis.	1
According	1
to	1
Laplace's	1
famous	1
form	1
of	1
this	1
theory	1
(1796),	1
the	1
solar	1
system	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
gigantic	1
glowing	1
mass,	1
spinning	1
slowly	1
and	1
uniformly	1
around	1
its	1
centre.	1
As	1
the	1
incandescent	1
world-cloud	1
of	1
gas	1
cooled	1
and	1
its	1
speed	1
of	1
rotation	1
increased	1
the	1
shrinking	1
mass	1
gave	1
off	1
a	1
separate	1
whirling	1
ring,	1
which	1
broke	1
up	1
and	1
gathered	1
together	1
again	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
distant	1
planet.	1
The	1
main	1
mass	1
gave	1
off	1
another	1
ring	1
and	1
another	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
planets,	1
including	1
the	1
earth,	1
were	1
formed.	1
The	1
central	1
mass	1
persisted	1
as	1
the	1
sun.	1
Laplace	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
theory,	1
which	1
Kant	1
had	1
anticipated	1
forty-one	1
years	1
before,	1
with	1
scientific	1
caution:	1
"conjectures	1
which	1
I	1
present	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
distrust	1
which	1
everything	1
not	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
observation	1
or	1
of	1
calculation	1
ought	1
to	1
inspire."	1
Subsequent	1
research	1
justified	1
his	1
distrust,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
original	1
nebula	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
hot	1
and	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
gaseous.	1
Moreover,	1
there	1
are	1
great	1
difficulties	1
in	1
Laplace's	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
successive	1
rings	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
mass,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
condensation	1
of	1
a	1
whirling	1
gaseous	1
ring	1
into	1
a	1
planet.	1
So	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
about	1
that	1
the	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
hot	1
gaseous	1
nebula	1
revolving	1
as	1
a	1
unit	1
body	1
has	1
given	1
place	1
to	1
other	1
pictures.	1
Thus	1
Sir	1
Norman	1
Lockyer	1
pointed	1
out	1
(1890)	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
gathering	1
to	1
itself	1
millions	1
of	1
meteorites	1
every	1
day;	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years;	1
in	1
distant	1
ages	1
the	1
accretion	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
vastly	1
more	1
rapid	1
and	1
voluminous;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
earth	1
has	1
grown!	1
Now	1
the	1
meteoritic	1
contributions	1
are	1
undoubted,	1
but	1
they	1
require	1
a	1
centre	1
to	1
attract	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
difficulty	1
is	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
collecting	1
centre	1
or	1
planetary	1
nucleus.	1
Moreover,	1
meteorites	1
are	1
sporadic	1
and	1
erratic,	1
scattered	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
rather	1
than	1
collecting	1
into	1
unit-bodies.	1
As	1
Professor	1
Chamberlin	1
says,	1
"meteorites	1
have	1
rather	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
wreckage	1
of	1
some	1
earlier	1
organisation	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
parentage	1
of	1
our	1
planetary	1
system."	1
Several	1
other	1
theories	1
have	1
been	1
propounded	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
found	1
most	1
favour	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
authorities	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
Chamberlin	1
and	1
Moulton.	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
theory	1
a	1
great	1
nebular	1
mass	1
condensed	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
sun,	1
from	1
which	1
under	1
the	1
attraction	1
of	1
passing	1
stars	1
planet	1
after	1
planet,	1
the	1
earth	1
included,	1
was	1
heaved	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
knotted	1
spiral	1
nebulælike	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
now	1
observed	1
in	1
the	1
heavens.	1
Of	1
great	1
importance	1
were	1
the	1
"knots,"	1
for	1
they	1
served	1
as	1
collecting	1
centres	1
drawing	1
flying	1
matter	1
into	1
their	1
clutches.	1
Whatever	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
primitive	1
bolt	1
escaped	1
and	1
scattered	1
was	1
drawn	1
out	1
into	1
independent	1
orbits	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
forming	1
the	1
"planetesimals"	1
which	1
behave	1
like	1
minute	1
planets.	1
These	1
planetesimals	1
formed	1
the	1
food	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
knots	1
subsequently	1
fed.	1
The	1
Growth	1
of	1
the	1
Earth	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
calculated	1
that	1
the	1
newborn	1
earth--the	1
"earth-knot"	1
of	1
Chamberlin's	1
theory--had	1
a	1
diameter	1
of	1
about	1
5,500	1
miles.	1
But	1
it	1
grew	1
by	1
drawing	1
planetesimals	1
into	1
itself	1
until	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
diameter	1
of	1
over	1
8,100	1
miles	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
its	1
growing	1
period.	1
Since	1
then	1
it	1
has	1
shrunk,	1
by	1
periodic	1
shrinkages	1
which	1
have	1
meant	1
the	1
buckling	1
up	1
of	1
successive	1
series	1
of	1
mountains,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
now	1
a	1
diameter	1
of	1
7,918	1
miles.	1
But	1
during	1
the	1
shrinking	1
the	1
earth	1
became	1
more	1
varied.	1
A	1
sort	1
of	1
slow	1
boiling	1
of	1
the	1
internally	1
hot	1
earth	1
often	1
forced	1
molten	1
matter	1
through	1
the	1
cold	1
outer	1
crust,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
about	1
a	1
gradual	1
assortment	1
of	1
lighter	1
materials	1
nearer	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
heavier	1
materials	1
deeper	1
down.	1
The	1
continents	1
are	1
built	1
of	1
the	1
lighter	1
materials,	1
such	1
as	1
granites,	1
while	1
the	1
beds	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
oceans	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
heavier	1
materials	1
such	1
as	1
basalts.	1
In	1
limited	1
areas	1
land	1
has	1
often	1
become	1
sea,	1
and	1
sea	1
has	1
often	1
given	1
place	1
to	1
land,	1
but	1
the	1
probability	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
distinction	1
of	1
the	1
areas	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
continents	1
and	1
oceans	1
goes	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
stage.	1
The	1
lithosphere	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
stable	1
crust	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
about	1
fifty	1
miles	1
in	1
thickness.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
earth	1
had	1
no	1
atmosphere,	1
and	1
that	1
ages	1
passed	1
before	1
water	1
began	1
to	1
accumulate	1
on	1
its	1
surface--before,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
hydrosphere.	1
The	1
water	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
itself,	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
rain	1
dissolving	1
out	1
saline	1
matter	1
from	1
the	1
exposed	1
rocks	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
sea	1
salt.	1
The	1
weathering	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
grounds	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
crust	1
by	1
air	1
and	1
water	1
furnished	1
the	1
material	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
sandstones	1
and	1
mudstones	1
and	1
other	1
sedimentary	1
rocks,	1
which	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
a	1
thickness	1
of	1
over	1
fifty	1
miles	1
in	1
all.	1
§	1
3	1
Making	1
a	1
Home	1
for	1
Life	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
the	1
callous,	1
rough-and-tumble	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
outer	1
world	1
in	1
early	1
days	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
others	1
that	1
allowed	1
of	1
the	1
germination	1
and	1
growth	1
of	1
that	1
tender	1
plant	1
we	1
call	1
LIFE.	1
There	1
are	1
very	1
tough	1
living	1
creatures,	1
but	1
the	1
average	1
organism	1
is	1
ill	1
suited	1
for	1
violence.	1
Most	1
living	1
creatures	1
are	1
adapted	1
to	1
mild	1
temperatures	1
and	1
gentle	1
reactions.	1
Hence	1
the	1
fundamental	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
atmosphere,	1
heavy	1
with	1
planetesimal	1
dust,	1
in	1
blanketing	1
the	1
earth	1
against	1
intensities	1
of	1
radiance	1
from	1
without,	1
as	1
Chamberlin	1
says,	1
and	1
inequalities	1
of	1
radiance	1
from	1
within.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
preparation	1
for	1
life,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
without	1
free	1
oxygen.	1
Not	1
less	1
important	1
was	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
pools	1
and	1
lakelets,	1
of	1
lakes	1
and	1
seas.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
early	1
waters	1
covered	1
the	1
earth.	1
And	1
water	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
preparation	1
for	1
life--water,	1
that	1
can	1
dissolve	1
a	1
larger	1
variety	1
of	1
substances	1
in	1
greater	1
concentration	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
liquid;	1
water,	1
that	1
in	1
summer	1
does	1
not	1
readily	1
evaporate	1
altogether	1
from	1
a	1
pond,	1
nor	1
in	1
winter	1
freeze	1
throughout	1
its	1
whole	1
extent;	1
water,	1
that	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
mobile	1
vehicle	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
subtle	1
cleaver	1
of	1
substances;	1
water,	1
that	1
forms	1
over	1
80	1
per	1
cent.	1
of	1
living	1
matter	1
itself.	1
Of	1
great	1
significance	1
was	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
carbon,	1
hydrogen,	1
and	1
oxygen	1
(in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
carbonic	1
acid	1
and	1
water)	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
the	1
cooling	1
earth,	1
for	1
these	1
three	1
wonderful	1
elements	1
have	1
a	1
unique	1
_ensemble_	1
of	1
properties--ready	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
reactions	1
and	1
relations,	1
making	1
great	1
diversity	1
and	1
complexity	1
possible,	1
favouring	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
plastic	1
and	1
permeable	1
materials	1
that	1
build	1
up	1
living	1
creatures.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
pursue	1
the	1
idea,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
stones	1
and	1
mortar	1
of	1
the	1
inanimate	1
world	1
are	1
such	1
that	1
they	1
built	1
a	1
friendly	1
home	1
for	1
life.	1

living	1
creature	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
imagine	1
could	1
possibly	1
have	1
lived	1
there.	1
The	1

was	1
too	1
high;	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1

Therefore	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
at	1
some	1
uncertain,	1
but	1
inconceivably	1
distant	1
date,	1
living	1
creatures	1
appeared	1
upon	1
the	1

No	1
one	1
knows	1
how,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
consider	1
possibilities.	1

The	1
amoeba	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
simplest	1
of	1
all	1
animals,	1
and	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
ancestors.	1
It	1
looks	1

speck	1
of	1
greyish	1
jelly,	1
about	1
1/100th	1
of	1
an	1

in	1

It	1
is	1
commonly	1
found	1
gliding	1
on	1
the	1

in	1

where	1
it	1

From	1
ancient	1
times	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
favourite	1
answer	1
that	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
may	1
have	1
become	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
is	1
outside	1
scientific	1
description.	1
This	1
answer	1
forecloses	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
too	1
soon	1
to	1
do	1
that.	1
Science	1
must	1
often	1
say	1
"Ignoramus":	1
Science	1
should	1
be	1
slow	1
to	1
say	1
"Ignorabimus."	1
A	1
second	1
position	1
held	1
by	1
Helmholtz,	1
Lord	1
Kelvin,	1
and	1
others,	1
suggests	1
that	1
minute	1
living	1
creatures	1
may	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
elsewhere,	1
in	1
the	1
cracks	1
of	1
a	1
meteorite	1
or	1
among	1
cosmic	1
dust.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
seeds	1
can	1
survive	1
prolonged	1
exposure	1
to	1
very	1
low	1
temperatures;	1
that	1
spores	1
of	1
bacteria	1
can	1
survive	1
high	1
temperature;	1
that	1
seeds	1
of	1
plants	1
and	1
germs	1
of	1
animals	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
"latent	1
life"	1
can	1
survive	1
prolonged	1
drought	1
and	1
absence	1
of	1
oxygen.	1
It	1
is	1
possible,	1
according	1
to	1
Berthelot,	1
that	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
molecular	1
disintegration	1
vital	1
activities	1
may	1
be	1
suspended	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
may	1
afterwards	1
recommence	1
when	1
appropriate	1
conditions	1
are	1
restored.	1
Therefore,	1
one	1
should	1
be	1
slow	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
long	1
journey	1
through	1
space	1
is	1
impossible.	1
The	1
obvious	1
limitation	1
of	1
Lord	1
Kelvin's	1
theory	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
only	1
shifts	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
organisms	1
(i.e.	1
living	1
creatures)	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
elsewhere.	1
The	1
third	1
answer	1
is	1
that	1
living	1
creatures	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
simple	1
sort	1
may	1
have	1
emerged	1
on	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface	1
from	1
not-living	1
material,	1
e.g.	1
from	1
some	1
semi-fluid	1
carbon	1
compounds	1
activated	1
by	1
ferments.	1
The	1
tenability	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
is	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
the	1
synthetic	1
chemists,	1
who	1
are	1
able	1
artificially	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
substances	1
such	1
as	1
oxalic	1
acid,	1
indigo,	1
salicylic	1
acid,	1
caffeine,	1
and	1
grape-sugar.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
indeed,	1
what	1
in	1
Nature's	1
laboratory	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
clever	1
synthetic	1
chemist,	1
but	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
complexity.	1
Corpuscles	1
form	1
atoms,	1
atoms	1
form	1
molecules,	1
small	1
molecules	1
large	1
ones.	1
Various	1
concrete	1
suggestions	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
possible	1
origin	1
of	1
living	1
matter,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
a	1
later	1
chapter.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
to-day,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
evidence	1
of	1
spontaneous	1
generation;	1
organisms	1
seem	1
always	1
to	1
arise	1
from	1
pre-existing	1
organisms	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind;	1
where	1
any	1
suggestion	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
has	1
been	1
fancied,	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
flaws	1
in	1
the	1
experimenting.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
verdict	1
"omne	1
vivum	1
e	1
vivo"	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
to	1
which	1
experiment	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
discovered	1
an	1
exception	1
and	1
another	1
thing	1
to	1
maintain	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
always	1
have	1
been	1
true	1
or	1
must	1
always	1
remain	1
true.	1
If	1
the	1
synthetic	1
chemists	1
should	1
go	1
on	1
surpassing	1
themselves,	1
if	1
substances	1
like	1
white	1
of	1
egg	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
artificially,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
get	1
more	1
light	1
on	1
possible	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
simple	1
living	1
creatures	1
may	1
have	1
arisen	1
from	1
not-living	1
materials,	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
greatly	1
affect	1
our	1
general	1
outlook	1
on	1
life,	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
increase	1
our	1
appreciation	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
often	1
libelled	1
as	1
"inert"	1
matter.	1
If	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
did	1
naturally	1
give	1
rise	1
very	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
living	1
creatures,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
real	1
sense	1
born	1
of	1
her	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sunshine,	1
then	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
becomes	1
more	1
continuous	1
and	1
more	1
vital,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inorganic	1
groaning	1
and	1
travailing	1
becomes	1
more	1
intelligible.	1
§	1
4	1
The	1
First	1
Organisms	1
upon	1
the	1
Earth	1
We	1
cannot	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
speculative	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
living	1
creatures	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
or,	1
rather,	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
that	1
covered	1
the	1
earth.	1
A	1
basis	1
for	1
speculation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
however,	1
in	1
the	1
simplest	1
creatures	1
living	1
to-day,	1
such	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
bacteria	1
and	1
one-celled	1
animalcules,	1
especially	1
those	1
called	1
Protists,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
taken	1
any	1
very	1
definite	1
step	1
towards	1
becoming	1
either	1
plants	1
or	1
animals.	1
No	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
sure,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
creatures	1
were	1
microscopic	1
globules	1
of	1
living	1
matter,	1
not	1
unlike	1
the	1
simplest	1
bacteria	1
of	1
to-day,	1
but	1
able	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
air,	1
water,	1
and	1
dissolved	1
salts.	1
From	1
such	1
a	1
source	1
may	1
have	1
originated	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
one-celled	1
marine	1
organisms	1
which	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
manufacture	1
chlorophyll,	1
or	1
something	1
like	1
chlorophyll,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
green	1
pigment	1
which	1
makes	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
plants	1
to	1
utilise	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
sunlight	1
in	1
breaking	1
up	1
carbon	1
dioxide	1
and	1
in	1
building	1
up	1
(photosynthesis)	1
carbon	1
compounds	1
like	1
sugars	1
and	1
starch.	1
These	1
little	1
units	1
were	1
probably	1
encased	1
in	1
a	1
cell-wall	1
of	1
cellulose,	1
but	1
their	1
boxed-in	1
energy	1
expressed	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
undulatory	1
movement	1
of	1
a	1
lash	1
or	1
flagellum,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
propelled	1
themselves	1
energetically	1
through	1
the	1
water.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
similar	1
organisms	1
to-day,	1
mostly	1
in	1
water,	1
but	1
some	1
of	1
them--simple	1
one-celled	1
plants--paint	1
the	1
tree-stems	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
paving-stones	1
green	1
in	1
wet	1
weather.	1
According	1
to	1
Prof.	1
A.	1
H.	1
Church	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
chapter	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
when	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
covered	1
everything	1
teemed	1
with	1
these	1
green	1
flagellates--the	1
originators	1
of	1
the	1
Vegetable	1
Kingdom.	1
On	1
another	1
tack,	1
however,	1
there	1
probably	1
evolved	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
simple	1
predatory	1
creatures,	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
build	1
up	1
organic	1
matter	1
from	1
air,	1
water,	1
and	1
salts,	1
but	1
devouring	1
their	1
neighbours.	1
These	1
units	1
were	1
not	1
closed	1
in	1
with	1
cellulose,	1
but	1
remained	1
naked,	1
with	1
their	1
living	1
matter	1
or	1
protoplasm	1
flowing	1
out	1
in	1
changeful	1
processes,	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
Amoebæn	1
the	1
ditch	1
or	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
white	1
blood	1
corpuscles	1
and	1
other	1
amoeboid	1
cells.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
originators	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
kingdom.	1
Thus	1
from	1
very	1
simple	1
Protists	1
the	1
first	1
animals	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
plants	1
may	1
have	1
arisen.	1
All	1
were	1
still	1
very	1
minute,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
remembering	1
that	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
any	1
scientific	1
spectator	1
after	1
our	1
kind	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
during	1
these	1
long	1
ages,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
lamented	1
the	1
entire	1
absence	1
of	1
life,	1
although	1
the	1
seas	1
were	1
teeming.	1
The	1
simplest	1
forms	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
protoplasm	1
which	1
Huxley	1
called	1
the	1
physical	1
basis	1
of	1
life	1
will	1
be	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
chapter	1
on	1
Biology	1
in	1
a	1

1	1
The	1
Contrast	1
between	1
Plants	1
and	1
Animals	1
However	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
come	1
about,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
Organic	1
Evolution	1
was	1
the	1
forking	1
of	1
the	1
genealogical	1
tree	1
into	1
Plants	1
and	1
Animals--the	1
most	1
important	1
parting	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
Nature.	1
Typical	1
plants	1
have	1
chlorophyll;	1
they	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
feed	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
chemical	1
level	1
on	1
air,	1
water,	1
and	1
salts,	1
using	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
sunlight	1
in	1
their	1
photosynthesis.	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
cells	1
boxed	1
in	1
by	1
cellulose	1
walls,	1
so	1
that	1
their	1
opportunities	1
for	1
motility	1
are	1
greatly	1
restricted.	1
They	1
manufacture	1
much	1
more	1
nutritive	1
material	1
than	1
they	1
need,	1
and	1
live	1
far	1
below	1
their	1
income.	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
ready	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
any	1
nitrogenous	1
waste	1
matter	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
form,	1
and	1
this	1
probably	1
helps	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
sluggish.	1
Animals,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
feed	1
at	1
a	1
high	1
chemical	1
level,	1
on	1
the	1
carbohydrates	1
(e.g.	1
starch	1
and	1
sugar),	1
fats,	1
and	1
proteins	1
(e.g.	1
gluten,	1
albumin,	1
casein)	1
which	1
are	1
manufactured	1
by	1
other	1
animals,	1
or	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
by	1
plants.	1
Their	1
cells	1
have	1
not	1
cellulose	1
walls,	1
nor	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
much	1
wall	1
of	1
any	1
kind,	1
and	1
motility	1
in	1
the	1
majority	1
is	1
unrestricted.	1
Animals	1
live	1
much	1
more	1
nearly	1
up	1
to	1
their	1
income.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
make	1
for	1
an	1
animal	1
and	1
a	1
plant	1
of	1
equal	1
weight	1
two	1
fractions	1
showing	1
the	1
ratio	1
of	1
the	1
upbuilding,	1
constructive,	1
chemical	1
processes	1
to	1
the	1
down-breaking,	1
disruptive,	1
chemical	1
processes	1
that	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
their	1
respective	1
bodies,	1
the	1
ratio	1
for	1
the	1
plant	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
corresponding	1
ratio	1
for	1
the	1
animal.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
animals	1
take	1
the	1
munitions	1
which	1
plants	1
laboriously	1
manufacture	1
and	1
explode	1
them	1
in	1
locomotion	1
and	1
work;	1
and	1
the	1
entire	1
system	1
of	1
animate	1
nature	1
depends	1
upon	1
the	1
photosynthesis	1
that	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
green	1
plants.	1

As	1
the	1

of	1
much	1
more	1

life,	1
animals	1

to	1
deal	1
with	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
nitrogenous	1

the	1

very	1
effectively,	1

by	1

the	1
like,	1
as	1
happens	1
in	1
plants.	1
Sluggish	1

sea-squirts	1
which	1

no	1

are	1
exceptions	1
that	1

it	1

to	1
the	1

There	1

a	1

about	1
the	1

as	1

The	1
Beginnings	1
of	1
Land	1
Plants	1
It	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
for	1
long	1
ages	1
the	1
waters	1
covered	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
primeval	1
vegetation	1
consisted	1
of	1
simple	1
Flagellates	1
in	1
the	1
universal	1
Open	1
Sea.	1
But	1
contraction	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
crust	1
brought	1
about	1
elevations	1
and	1
depressions	1
of	1
the	1
sea-floor,	1
and	1
in	1
places	1
the	1
solid	1
substratum	1
was	1
brought	1
near	1
enough	1
the	1
surface	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
floating	1
plants	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
settle	1
down	1
without	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
light.	1
This	1
is	1
how	1
Professor	1
Church	1
pictures	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
fixed	1
vegetation--a	1
very	1
momentous	1
step	1
in	1
evolution.	1
It	1
was	1
perhaps	1
among	1
this	1
early	1
vegetation	1
that	1
animals	1
had	1
their	1
first	1
successes.	1
As	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
in	1
these	1
shallow	1
areas	1
was	1
raised	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
beginning	1
of	1
dry	1
land.	1
The	1
sedentary	1
plants	1
already	1
spoken	1
of	1
were	1
the	1
ancestors	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
seaweeds,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
go	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
lowest	1
tide	1
and	1
wade	1
cautiously	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
jungle	1
of	1
vegetation	1
only	1
exposed	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
we	1
are	1
getting	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
very	1
ancient	1
days.	1
_This_	1
is	1
the	1
forest	1
primeval.	1
The	1
Protozoa	1
Animals	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
zoophytes	1
and	1
sponges	1
are	1
called	1
Protozoa.	1
The	1
word	1
obviously	1
means	1
"First	1
Animals,"	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
simplest	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
first	1
animals.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
vast	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
Protozoa	1
to-day	1
are	1
far	1
too	1
complicated	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
as	1
primitive.	1
Though	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
microscopic,	1
each	1
is	1
an	1
animal	1
complete	1
in	1
itself,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
fundamental	1
bodily	1
attributes	1
as	1
are	1
manifested	1
in	1
ourselves.	1
They	1
differ	1
from	1
animals	1
of	1
higher	1
degree	1
in	1
not	1
being	1
built	1
up	1
of	1
the	1
unit	1
areas	1
or	1
corpuscles	1
called	1
cells.	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
cells,	1
no	1
tissues,	1
no	1
organs,	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
acceptation	1
of	1
these	1
words,	1
but	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
show	1
a	1
great	1
complexity	1
of	1
internal	1
structure,	1
far	1
exceeding	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
cells	1
that	1
build	1
up	1
the	1
tissues	1
of	1
higher	1
animals.	1
They	1
are	1
complete	1
living	1
creatures	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
gone	1
in	1
for	1
body-making.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
and	1
distant	1
past	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
only	1
animals	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
Protozoa,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
safe	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
evolution	1
was	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
three	1
great	1
types	1
of	1
Protozoa:	1
(_a_)	1
Some	1
were	1
very	1
active,	1
the	1
Infusorians,	1
like	1
the	1
slipper	1
animalcule,	1
the	1
night-light	1
(Noctiluca),	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
seas	1
phosphorescent	1
at	1
night,	1
and	1
the	1
deadly	1
Trypanosome,	1
which	1
causes	1
Sleeping	1
Sickness.	1
(_b_)	1
Others	1
were	1
very	1
sluggish,	1
the	1
parasitic	1
Sporozoa,	1
like	1
the	1
malaria	1
organism	1
which	1
the	1
mosquito	1
introduces	1
into	1
man's	1
body.	1
(_c_)	1
Others	1
were	1
neither	1
very	1
active	1
nor	1
very	1
passive,	1
the	1
Rhizopods,	1
with	1
out-flowing	1
processes	1
of	1
living	1
matter.	1
This	1
amoeboid	1
line	1
of	1
evolution	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
successful;	1
it	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
Rhizopods,	1
such	1
as	1
Amoebænd	1
the	1
chalk-forming	1
Foraminifera	1
and	1
the	1
exquisitely	1
beautiful	1
flint-shelled	1
Radiolarians	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea.	1
They	1
have	1
their	1
counterparts	1
in	1
the	1
amoeboid	1
cells	1
of	1
most	1
multicellular	1
animals,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
phagocytes	1
which	1
migrate	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
engulfing	1
and	1
digesting	1
intruding	1
bacteria,	1
serving	1
as	1
sappers	1
and	1
miners	1
when	1
something	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
down	1
and	1
built	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
performing	1
other	1
useful	1
offices.	1
§	1
3	1
The	1
Making	1
of	1
a	1
Body	1
The	1
great	1
naturalist	1
Louis	1
Agassiz	1
once	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
biggest	1
gulf	1
in	1
Organic	1
Nature	1
was	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
unicellular	1
and	1
the	1
multicellular	1
animals	1
(Protozoa	1
and	1
Metazoa).	1
But	1
the	1
gulf	1
was	1
bridged	1
very	1
long	1
ago	1
when	1
sponges,	1
stinging	1
animals,	1
and	1
simple	1
worms	1
were	1
evolved,	1
and	1
showed,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
a	1
"body."	1
What	1
would	1
one	1
not	1
give	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
a	1
body,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
evolution!	1
No	1
one	1
knows,	1
but	1
the	1
problem	1
is	1
not	1
altogether	1
obscure.	1
When	1
an	1
ordinary	1
Protozoon	1
or	1
one-celled	1
animal	1
divides	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
more,	1
which	1
is	1
its	1
way	1
of	1
multiplying,	1
the	1
daughter-units	1
thus	1
formed	1
float	1
apart	1
and	1
live	1
independent	1
lives.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
Protozoa	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
daughter-units	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
separated	1
off	1
from	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
remain	1
coherent.	1
Thus	1
Volvox,	1
a	1
beautiful	1
green	1
ball,	1
found	1
in	1
some	1
canals	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
is	1
a	1
colony	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
or	1
even	1
ten	1
thousand	1
cells.	1
It	1
has	1
almost	1
formed	1
a	1
body!	1
But	1
in	1
this	1
"colony-making"	1
Protozoon,	1
and	1
in	1
others	1
like	1
it,	1
the	1
component	1
cells	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
kind,	1
whereas	1
in	1
true	1
multicellular	1
animals	1
there	1
are	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
cells,	1
showing	1
division	1
of	1
labour.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
other	1
Protozoa	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
nucleus	1
or	1
kernel	1
divides	1
into	1
many	1
nuclei	1
within	1
the	1
cell.	1
This	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
Giant	1
Amoeba	1
(Pelomyxa),	1
sometimes	1
found	1
in	1
duck-ponds,	1
or	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Opalina,	1
which	1
always	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
hind	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
frog's	1
food-canal.	1
If	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
matter	1
of	1
these	1
Protozoa	1
should	1
gather	1
round	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
nuclei,	1
then	1
_that	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
body_.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
nearer	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
if	1
division	1
of	1
labour	1
set	1
in,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
setting	1
apart	1
of	1
egg-cells	1
and	1
sperm-cells	1
distinct	1
from	1
body-cells.	1
It	1
was	1
possibly	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
way	1
that	1
animals	1
and	1
plants	1
with	1
a	1
body	1
were	1
first	1
evolved.	1
Two	1
points	1
should	1
be	1
noticed,	1
that	1
body-making	1
is	1
not	1
essentially	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
size,	1
though	1
it	1
made	1
large	1
size	1
possible.	1
For	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
many-celled	1
Wheel	1
Animalcule	1
or	1
Rotifer	1
is	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
many	1
a	1
Protozoon.	1
Yet	1
the	1
Rotifer--we	1
are	1
thinking	1
of	1
Hydatina--has	1
nine	1
hundred	1
odd	1
cells,	1
whereas	1
the	1
Protozoon	1
has	1
only	1
one,	1
except	1
in	1
forms	1
like	1
Volvox.	1
Secondly,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
luminous	1
fact	1
that	1
_every	1
many-celled	1
animal	1
from	1
sponge	1
to	1
man	1
that	1
multiplies	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
way	1
begins	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
again	1
as	1
a	1
"single	1
cell,"_	1
the	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell.	1
It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
not	1
an	1
ordinary	1
single	1
cell	1
that	1
develops	1
into	1
an	1
earthworm	1
or	1
a	1
butterfly,	1
an	1
eagle,	1
or	1
a	1
man;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
cell	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
rich	1
inheritance,	1
the	1
fruition	1
of	1
ages,	1
is	1
somehow	1
condensed;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
elementary	1
fact	1
that	1
every	1
many-celled	1
creature,	1
reproduced	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
way	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
budding	1
or	1
the	1
like,	1
starts	1
as	1
a	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell.	1
The	1
coherence	1
of	1
the	1
daughter-cells	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell	1
divides	1
is	1
a	1
reminiscence,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
of	1
the	1
primeval	1
coherence	1
of	1
daughter-units	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
first	1
body	1
possible.	1
The	1
Beginning	1
of	1
Sexual	1
Reproduction	1
A	1
freshwater	1
Hydra,	1
growing	1
on	1
the	1
duckweed	1
usually	1
multiplies	1
by	1
budding.	1
It	1
forms	1
daughter-buds,	1
living	1
images	1
of	1
itself;	1
a	1
check	1
comes	1
to	1
nutrition	1
and	1
these	1
daughter-buds	1
go	1
free.	1
A	1
big	1
sea-anemone	1
may	1
divide	1
in	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
parts,	1
which	1
become	1
separate	1
animals.	1
This	1
is	1
asexual	1
reproduction,	1
which	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
multiplication	1
takes	1
place	1
by	1
dividing	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
many	1
portions,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
liberating	1
egg-cells	1
and	1
sperm-cells.	1
Among	1
animals	1
as	1
among	1
plants,	1
asexual	1
reproduction	1
is	1
very	1
common.	1
But	1
it	1
has	1
great	1
disadvantages,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
physiologically	1
expensive,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
beset	1
with	1
difficulties	1
when	1
the	1
body	1
shows	1
great	1
division	1
of	1
labour,	1
and	1
is	1
very	1
intimately	1
bound	1
into	1
unity.	1
Thus,	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
bee	1
or	1
a	1
bird	1
multiplying	1
by	1
division	1
or	1
by	1
budding.	1
Moreover,	1
if	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
parent	1
has	1
suffered	1
from	1
injury	1
or	1
deterioration,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
handed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
if	1
asexual	1
reproduction	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
method.	1

Splitting	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
many	1
parts	1
was	1
the	1
old-fashioned	1
way	1
of	1
multiplying,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
evolution	1
was	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
method,	1
namely,	1
sexual	1
reproduction.	1
The	1
gist	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
simply	1
that	1
during	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
body-building	1
(by	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell)	1
certain	1
units,	1
_the	1
germ-cells_,	1
do	1
not	1
share	1
in	1
forming	1
ordinary	1
tissues	1
or	1
organs,	1
but	1
remain	1
apart,	1
continuing	1
the	1
full	1
inheritance	1
which	1
was	1
condensed	1
in	1
the	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell.	1
_These	1
cells	1
kept	1
by	1
themselves	1
are	1
the	1
originators	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
reproductive	1
cells	1
of	1
the	1
mature	1
animal_;	1
they	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
egg-cells	1
and	1
the	1
sperm-cells.	1
The	1
advantages	1
of	1
this	1
method	1
are	1
great.	1
(1)	1
The	1
new	1
generation	1
is	1
started	1
less	1
expensively,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
shed	1
germ-cells	1
into	1
the	1
cradle	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
than	1
to	1
separate	1
off	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
(2)	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
start	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
new	1
lives	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
vital	1
importance	1
when	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
is	1
very	1
keen,	1
and	1
when	1
parental	1
care	1
is	1
impossible.	1
(3)	1
The	1
germ-cells	1
are	1
little	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
prejudicially	1
affected	1
by	1
disadvantageous	1
dints	1
impressed	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
parent--little	1
likely	1
unless	1
the	1
dints	1
have	1
peculiarly	1
penetrating	1
consequences,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
poisons.	1
(4)	1
A	1
further	1
advantage	1
is	1
implied	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
germ-cells--the	1
ovum	1
or	1
egg-cell,	1
with	1
a	1
considerable	1
amount	1
of	1
building	1
material	1
and	1
often	1
with	1
a	1
legacy	1
of	1
nutritive	1
yolk;	1
the	1
spermatozoon	1
or	1
sperm-cell,	1
adapted	1
to	1
move	1
in	1
fluids	1
and	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
ovum	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
thus	1
securing	1
change-provoking	1
cross-fertilisation.	1
§	1

The	1
Evolution	1
of	1
Sex	1
Another	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
organic	1
evolution	1
was	1
the	1
differentiation	1
of	1
two	1
different	1
physiological	1
types,	1
the	1
male	1
or	1
sperm-producer	1
and	1
the	1
female	1
or	1
egg-producer.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
deep-seated	1
difference	1
in	1
constitution,	1
which	1
leads	1
one	1
egg	1
to	1
develop	1
into	1
a	1
male,	1
and	1
another,	1
lying	1
beside	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
nest,	1
into	1
a	1
female.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
pigeons	1
it	1
seems	1
almost	1
certain,	1
from	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Professor	1
Oscar	1
Riddle,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
egg,	1
a	1
male-producing	1
egg	1
and	1
a	1
female-producing	1
egg,	1
which	1
differ	1
in	1
their	1
yolk-forming	1
and	1
other	1
physiological	1
characters.	1
In	1
sea-urchins	1
we	1
often	1
find	1
two	1
creatures	1
superficially	1
indistinguishable,	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
a	1
female	1
with	1
large	1
ovaries	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
a	1
male	1
with	1
equally	1
large	1
testes.	1
Here	1
the	1
physiological	1
difference	1
does	1
not	1
affect	1
the	1
body	1
as	1
a	1
whole,	1
but	1
the	1
reproductive	1
organs	1
or	1
gonads	1
only,	1
though	1
more	1
intimate	1
physiology	1
would	1
doubtless	1
discover	1
differences	1
in	1
the	1
blood	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
chemical	1
routine	1
(metabolism).	1
In	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
cases,	1
however,	1
there	1
are	1
marked	1
superficial	1
differences	1
between	1
the	1
sexes,	1
and	1
everyone	1
is	1
familiar	1
with	1
such	1
contrasts	1
as	1
peacock	1
and	1
peahen,	1
stag	1
and	1
hind.	1
In	1
such	1
cases	1
the	1
physiological	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
sperm-producer	1
and	1
the	1
ovum-producer,	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
essential	1
difference,	1
saturates	1
through	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
expresses	1
itself	1
in	1
masculine	1
and	1
feminine	1
structures	1
and	1
modes	1
of	1
behaviour.	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
masculine	1
and	1
feminine	1
characters	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
under	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
hormones	1
or	1
chemical	1
messengers	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
from	1
the	1
reproductive	1
organs	1
throughout	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
pull	1
the	1
trigger	1
which	1
brings	1
about	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
an	1
antler	1
or	1
a	1
wattle	1
or	1
a	1
decorative	1
plume	1
or	1
a	1
capacity	1
for	1
vocal	1
and	1
saltatory	1
display.	1
In	1
some	1
cases	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
female	1
carries	1
in	1
a	1
latent	1
state	1
the	1
masculine	1
features,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
kept	1
from	1
expressing	1
themselves	1
by	1
other	1
chemical	1
messengers	1
from	1
the	1
ovary.	1
Of	1
these	1
chemical	1
messengers	1
more	1
must	1
be	1
said	1
later	1
on.	1
Recent	1
research	1
has	1
shown	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
male	1
and	1
female	1
is	1
very	1
deep-rooted,	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
difference	1
in	1
gearing,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
clear-cut.	1
Thus	1
a	1
hen-pigeon	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
masculine,	1
and	1
a	1
cock-pigeon	1
very	1
feminine.	1
The	1
difference	1
is	1
in	1
degree,	1
not	1
in	1
kind.	1

What	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
universal	1
or	1
almost	1
universal	1
inevitableness	1
of	1
death?	1
A	1

"Big	1

of	1
California	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
live	1

two	1
thousand	1
years,	1
but	1
eventually	1
it	1

A	1
centenarian	1
tortoise	1
has	1
been	1
known,	1
and	1
a	1
sea-anemone	1
sixty	1
years	1
of	1
age;	1
but	1
eventually	1
they	1
die.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
apparently	1
inevitable	1
stoppage	1
of	1
bodily	1
life?	1
The	1
Beginning	1
of	1
Natural	1
Death	1
There	1
are	1
three	1
chief	1
kinds	1
of	1
death,	1
(_a_)	1
The	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
animals	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
violent	1
end,	1
being	1
devoured	1
by	1
others	1
or	1
killed	1
by	1
sudden	1
and	1
extreme	1
changes	1
in	1
their	1
surroundings.	1
(_b_)	1
When	1
an	1
animal	1
enters	1
a	1
new	1
habitat,	1
or	1
comes	1
into	1
new	1
associations	1
with	1
other	1
organisms,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
invaded	1
by	1
a	1
microbe	1
or	1
by	1
some	1
larger	1
parasite	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
unaccustomed	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
offer	1
no	1
resistance.	1
With	1
many	1
parasites	1
a	1
"live-and-let-live"	1
compromise	1
is	1
arrived	1
at,	1
but	1
new	1
parasites	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
fatal,	1
as	1
man	1
knows	1
to	1
his	1
cost	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
bitten	1
by	1
a	1
tse-tse	1
fly	1
which	1
infects	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
microscopic	1
animal	1
(a	1
Trypanosome)	1
that	1
causes	1
Sleeping	1
Sickness.	1
In	1
many	1
animals	1
the	1
parasites	1
are	1
not	1
troublesome	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
host	1
is	1
vigorous,	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
host	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
condition	1
the	1
parasites	1
may	1
get	1
the	1
upper	1
hand,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
so-called	1
"grouse	1
disease,"	1
and	1
become	1
fatal.	1
(_c_)	1
But	1
besides	1
violent	1
death	1
and	1
microbic	1
(or	1
parasitic)	1
death,	1
there	1
is	1
natural	1
death.	1
This	1
is	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
price	1
paid	1
for	1
a	1
body.	1
A	1
body	1
worth	1
having	1
implies	1
complexity	1
or	1
division	1
of	1
labour,	1
and	1
this	1
implies	1
certain	1
internal	1
furnishings	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
stable	1
kind	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
wear	1
and	1
tear	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
accumulate.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
living	1
matter	1
itself	1
that	1
grows	1
old	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
framework	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
works--the	1
furnishings	1
of	1
the	1
vital	1
laboratory.	1
There	1
are	1
various	1
processes	1
of	1
rejuvenescence,	1
e.g.	1
rest,	1
repair,	1
change,	1
reorganisation,	1
which	1
work	1
against	1
the	1
inevitable	1
processes	1
of	1
senescence,	1
but	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
the	1
victory	1
is	1
with	1
ageing.	1
Another	1
deep	1
reason	1
for	1
natural	1
death	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
physiological	1
expensiveness	1
of	1
reproduction,	1
for	1
many	1
animals,	1
from	1
worms	1
to	1
eels,	1
illustrate	1
natural	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
nemesis	1
of	1
starting	1
new	1
lives.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
striking	1
fact	1
that	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
degree	1
the	1
simplest	1
animals	1
or	1
Protozoa	1
are	1
exempt	1
from	1
natural	1
death.	1
They	1
are	1
so	1
relatively	1
simple	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
continually	1
recuperate	1
by	1
rest	1
and	1
repair;	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
accumulate	1
any	1
bad	1
debts.	1
Moreover,	1
their	1
modes	1
of	1
multiplying,	1
by	1
dividing	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
many	1
units,	1
are	1
very	1
inexpensive	1
physiologically.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
this	1
bodily	1
immortality	1
of	1
the	1
Protozoa	1
is	1
shared	1
by	1
some	1
simple	1
many-celled	1
animals	1
like	1
the	1
freshwater	1
Hydra	1
and	1
Planarian	1
worms.	1
Here	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
chapter	1
in	1
evolution,	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
means	1
of	1
evading	1
or	1
staving	1
off	1
natural	1
death.	1
Thus	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
well-known	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Paloloworm	1
of	1
the	1
coral-reefs	1
where	1
the	1
body	1
breaks	1
up	1
in	1
liberating	1
the	1
germ-cells,	1
but	1
the	1
head-end	1
remains	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
crevice	1
of	1
the	1
coral,	1
and	1
buds	1
out	1
a	1
new	1
body	1
at	1
leisure.	1
Along	1
with	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
avoiding	1
death	1
should	1
be	1
considered	1
also	1
the	1
gradual	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
life	1
best	1
suited	1
to	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
species,	1
and	1
the	1
punctuation	1
of	1
the	1
life-history	1
to	1
suit	1
various	1
conditions.	1

§	1
6	1
Great	1
Acquisitions	1
In	1
animals	1
like	1
sea-anemones	1
and	1
jellyfishes	1
the	1
general	1
symmetry	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
radial;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
right	1
or	1
left,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
might	1
be	1
halved	1
along	1
many	1
planes.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
symmetry	1
well	1
suited	1
for	1
sedentary	1
or	1
for	1
drifting	1
life.	1
But	1
worms	1
began	1
the	1
profitable	1
habit	1
of	1
moving	1
with	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
always	1
in	1
front,	1
and	1
from	1
worms	1
to	1
man	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
animals	1
have	1
bilateral	1
symmetry.	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
and	1
a	1
left	1
side,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
cut	1
that	1
halves	1
the	1
body.	1
This	1
kind	1
of	1
symmetry	1
is	1
suited	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
strenuous	1
life	1
than	1
radial	1
animals	1
show;	1
it	1
is	1
suited	1
for	1
pursuing	1
food,	1
for	1
avoiding	1
enemies,	1
for	1
chasing	1
mates.	1
And	1
_with	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
bilateral	1
symmetry	1
must	1
be	1
associated	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
head-brains_,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
some	1
simple	1
worm-types.	1
Among	1
the	1
other	1
great	1
acquisitions	1
gradually	1
evolved	1
we	1
may	1
notice:	1
a	1
well-developed	1
head	1
with	1
sense-organs,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
large	1
internal	1
surfaces	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
digestive	1
and	1
absorptive	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
food-canal,	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
quickly	1
contracting	1
striped	1
muscle	1
and	1
of	1
muscular	1
appendages,	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
blood	1
as	1
a	1
distributing	1
medium	1
throughout	1
the	1
body,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
take	1
what	1
they	1
need	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
also	1
contribute.	1
Another	1
very	1
important	1
acquisition,	1
almost	1
confined	1
(so	1
far	1
as	1
is	1
known)	1
to	1
backboned	1
animals,	1
was	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
glands	1
of	1
internal	1
secretion,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
thyroid	1
and	1
the	1
supra-renal.	1
These	1
manufacture	1
subtle	1
chemical	1
substances	1
which	1
are	1
distributed	1
by	1
the	1
blood	1
throughout	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
manifold	1
influence	1
in	1
regulating	1
and	1
harmonising	1
the	1
vital	1
processes.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
chemical	1
messengers	1
are	1
called	1
hormones,	1
which	1
stimulate	1
organs	1
and	1
tissues	1
to	1
greater	1
activity;	1
others	1
are	1
called	1
chalones,	1
which	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
brake.	1
Some	1
regulate	1
growth	1
and	1
others	1
rapidly	1
alter	1
the	1
pressure	1
and	1
composition	1
of	1
the	1
blood.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
call	1
into	1
active	1
development	1
certain	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
which	1
have	1
been,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
appropriate	1
trigger-pulling.	1
Thus,	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time,	1
the	1
milk-glands	1
of	1
a	1
mammalian	1
mother	1
are	1
awakened	1
from	1
their	1
dormancy.	1
This	1
very	1
interesting	1
outcome	1
of	1
evolution	1
will	1
be	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
another	1
portion	1
of	1
this	1
work.	1
THE	1
INCLINED	1
PLANE	1
OF	1
ANIMAL	1
BEHAVIOUR	1
§	1
1	1
Before	1
passing	1
to	1
a	1
connected	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
gradual	1
emergence	1
of	1
higher	1
and	1
higher	1
forms	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
successive	1
ages--the	1
procession	1
of	1
life,	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
called--it	1
will	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
animal	1
behaviour.	1
Evolution	1
of	1
Mind	1
A	1
human	1
being	1
begins	1
as	1
a	1
microscopic	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell,	1
within	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
condensed	1
the	1
long	1
result	1
of	1
time--Man's	1
inheritance.	1
The	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
nine	1
months	1
before	1
birth,	1
with	1
its	1
intimate	1
partnership	1
between	1
mother	1
and	1
offspring,	1
is	1
passed	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
sleep,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
make	1
any	1
statement	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
unborn	1
child.	1
Even	1
after	1
birth	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
mind	1
is	1
as	1
slow	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful.	1
To	1
begin	1
with,	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
ovum	1
and	1
early	1
embryo	1
no	1
nervous	1
system	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
it	1
develops	1
very	1
gradually	1
from	1
simple	1
beginnings.	1
Yet	1
as	1
mentality	1
cannot	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
outside,	1
we	1
seem	1
bound	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
potentiality	1
of	1
it--whatever	1
that	1
means--resides	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first.	1
The	1
particular	1
kind	1
of	1
activity	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
as	1
thinking,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
willing	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
experience,	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
directly	1
apart	1
from	1
our	1
senses,	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
implicit	1
in	1
the	1
germ-cell	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
Newton	1
was	1
implicit	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
miserable	1
specimen	1
of	1
an	1
infant.	1
Now	1
what	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
is	1
true	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
race--there	1
is	1
a	1
gradual	1
evolution	1
of	1
that	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature's	1
activity	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
mind.	1
We	1
cannot	1
put	1
our	1
finger	1
on	1
any	1
point	1
and	1
say:	1
Before	1
this	1
stage	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
mind.	1
Indeed,	1
many	1
facts	1
suggest	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
wherever	1
there	1
is	1
life	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
mind--even	1
in	1
the	1
plants.	1
Or	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
accurate	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
conclusion	1
in	1
another	1
way,	1
that	1
the	1
activity	1
we	1
call	1
life	1
has	1
always	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
an	1
inner	1
or	1
mental	1
aspect.	1

from	1
time	1
immemorial.]	1
In	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
backboned	1
animals;	1
what	1
we	1
aim	1
at	1
here	1
is	1
an	1
outline	1
of	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
inclined	1
plane	1
of	1
animal	1
behaviour.	1
A	1
very	1
simple	1
animal	1
accumulates	1
a	1
little	1
store	1
of	1
potential	1
energy,	1
and	1
it	1
proceeds	1
to	1
expend	1
this,	1
like	1
an	1
explosive,	1
by	1
acting	1
on	1
its	1
environment.	1
It	1
does	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
characteristic	1
self-preservative	1
fashion,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
burns	1
without	1
being	1
consumed	1
and	1
explodes	1
without	1
being	1
blown	1
to	1
bits.	1
It	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
organism	1
that	1
it	1
remains	1
a	1
going	1
concern	1
for	1
a	1
longer	1
or	1
shorter	1
period--its	1
length	1
of	1
life.	1
Living	1
creatures	1
that	1
expended	1
their	1
energy	1
ineffectively	1
or	1
self-destructively	1
would	1
be	1
eliminated	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence.	1
When	1
a	1
simple	1
one-celled	1
organism	1
explores	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
seen	1
under	1
a	1
microscope,	1
behaving	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
scouring	1
a	1
field	1
seen	1
through	1
a	1
telescope,	1
it	1
seems	1
permissible	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
something	1
corresponding	1
to	1
mental	1
endeavour	1
associated	1
with	1
its	1
activity.	1
This	1
impression	1
is	1
strengthened	1
when	1
an	1
amoeba	1
pursues	1
another	1
amoeba,	1
overtakes	1
it,	1
engulfs	1
it,	1
loses	1
it,	1
pursues	1
it	1
again,	1
recaptures	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
What	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
animalcule	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
potassium	1
pill	1
fizzing	1
about	1
in	1
a	1
basin	1
of	1
water,	1
nor	1
like	1
the	1
lurching	1
movements	1
of	1
a	1
gun	1
that	1
has	1
got	1
loose	1
and	1
"taken	1
charge"	1
on	1
board	1
ship.	1
Another	1
feature	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
locomotor	1
activity	1
of	1
an	1
animalcule	1
often	1
shows	1
a	1
distinct	1
individuality:	1
it	1
may	1
swim,	1
for	1
instance,	1
in	1
a	1
loose	1
spiral.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
side	1
to	1
vital	1
activity	1
besides	1
acting	1
upon	1
the	1
surrounding	1
world;	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
is	1
acted	1
on	1
by	1
influences	1
from	1
without.	1
The	1
organism	1
acts	1
on	1
its	1
environment;	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
shield:	1
the	1
environment	1
acts	1
upon	1
the	1
organism;	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
see	1
life	1
whole	1
we	1
must	1
recognise	1
these	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
living,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
missing	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
animal	1
life	1
if	1
we	1
fail	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
evolution	1
implies	1
becoming	1
more	1
advantageously	1
sensitive	1
to	1
the	1
environment,	1
making	1
more	1
of	1
its	1
influences,	1
shutting	1
out	1
profitless	1
stimuli,	1
and	1
opening	1
more	1
gateways	1
to	1
knowledge.	1
The	1
bird's	1
world	1
is	1
a	1
larger	1
and	1
finer	1
world	1
than	1
an	1
earthworm's;	1
the	1
world	1
means	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
bird	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
worm.	1
The	1
Trial	1
and	1
Error	1
Method	1
Simple	1
creatures	1
act	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
spontaneity	1
on	1
their	1
environment,	1
and	1
they	1
likewise	1
react	1
effectively	1
to	1
surrounding	1
stimuli.	1
Animals	1
come	1
to	1
have	1
definite	1
"answers	1
back,"	1
sometimes	1
several,	1
sometimes	1
only	1
one,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Slipper	1
Animalcule,	1
which	1
reverses	1
its	1
cilia	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
within	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
some	1
disturbing	1
influence,	1
retreats,	1
and,	1
turning	1
upon	1
itself	1
tentatively,	1
sets	1
off	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
general	1
direction	1
as	1
before,	1
but	1
at	1
an	1
angle	1
to	1
the	1
previous	1
line.	1
If	1
it	1
misses	1
the	1
disturbing	1
influence,	1
well	1
and	1
good;	1
if	1
it	1
strikes	1
it	1
again,	1
the	1
tactics	1
are	1
repeated	1
until	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
way	1
out	1
is	1
discovered	1
or	1
the	1
stimulation	1
proves	1
fatal.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Slipper	1
Animalcule	1
has	1
but	1
one	1
answer	1
to	1
every	1
question,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
Protozoa	1
which	1
have	1
several	1
enregistered	1
reactions.	1
When	1
there	1
are	1
alternative	1
reactions	1
which	1
are	1
tried	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
pursuing	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
trial-and-error	1
method,	1
and	1
a	1
higher	1
note	1
is	1
struck.	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
endeavour	1
after	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
answers.	1
When	1
the	1
creature	1
profits	1
by	1
experience	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
giving	1
the	1
right	1
answer	1
first,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
learning.	1

Reflex	1
Actions	1
Among	1
simple	1
multicellular	1
animals,	1
such	1
as	1
sea-anemones,	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
reflex	1
actions,	1
and	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
lower	1
animals	1
is	1
reflex.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
there	1
are	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
animal	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
its	1
development	1
certain	1
pre-arrangements	1
of	1
nerve-cells	1
and	1
muscle-cells	1
which	1
secure	1
that	1
a	1
fit	1
and	1
proper	1
answer	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
frequently	1
recurrent	1
stimulus.	1
An	1
earthworm	1
half	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
burrow	1
becomes	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
tread	1
of	1
a	1
thrush's	1
foot,	1
and	1
jerks	1
itself	1
back	1
into	1
its	1
hole	1
before	1
anyone	1
can	1
say	1
"reflex	1
action."	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
happens?	1
Certain	1
sensory	1
nerve-cells	1
in	1
the	1
earthworm's	1
skin	1
are	1
stimulated	1
by	1
vibrations	1
in	1
the	1
earth;	1
the	1
message	1
travels	1
down	1
a	1
sensory	1
nerve-fibre	1
from	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
stimulated	1
cells	1
and	1
enters	1
the	1
nerve-cord.	1
The	1
sensory	1
fibres	1
come	1
into	1
vital	1
connection	1
with	1
branches	1
of	1
intermediary,	1
associative,	1
or	1
communicating	1
cells,	1
which	1
are	1
likewise	1
connected	1
with	1
motor	1
nerve-cells.	1
To	1
these	1
the	1
message	1
is	1
thus	1
shunted.	1
From	1
the	1
motor	1
nerve-cells	1
an	1
impulse	1
or	1
command	1
travels	1
by	1
motor	1
nerve-fibres,	1
one	1
from	1
each	1
cell,	1
to	1
the	1
muscles,	1
which	1
contract.	1
If	1
this	1
took	1
as	1
long	1
to	1
happen	1
as	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
describe,	1
even	1
in	1
outline,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
much	1
use	1
to	1
the	1
earthworm.	1
But	1
the	1
motor	1
answer	1
follows	1
the	1
sensory	1
stimulus	1
almost	1
instantaneously.	1
The	1
great	1
advantage	1
of	1
establishing	1
or	1
enregistering	1
these	1
reflex	1
chains	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
answers	1
are	1
practically	1
ready-made	1
or	1
inborn,	1
not	1
requiring	1
to	1
be	1
learned.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
brain	1
should	1
be	1
stimulated	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
brain;	1
nor	1
does	1
the	1
animal	1
will	1
to	1
act,	1
though	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
it	1
may	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
higher	1
controlling	1
nerve-centres	1
keep	1
the	1
natural	1
reflex	1
response	1
from	1
being	1
given,	1
as	1
happens,	1
for	1
instance,	1
when	1
we	1
control	1
a	1
cough	1
or	1
a	1
sneeze	1
on	1
some	1
solemn	1
occasion.	1
The	1
evolutionary	1
method,	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
use	1
the	1
expression,	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
enregister	1
ready-made	1
responses;	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
ascend	1
the	1
animal	1
kingdom,	1
we	1
find	1
reflex	1
actions	1
becoming	1
complicated	1
and	1
often	1
linked	1
together,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
occurrence	1
of	1
one	1
pulls	1
the	1
trigger	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
chain.	1

A	1

level	1

is	1

by	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
"tropisms,"	1

which	1
the	1

makes,	1
adjusting	1
its	1
whole	1

equilibrium	1
results	1
in	1

to	1

and	1
surfaces	1

the	1

next	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
more	1
illumined	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
a	1
physiological	1
inequilibrium	1
results,	1
affecting	1
nerve-cells	1
and	1
muscle-cells;	1
the	1
outcome	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
moth	1
automatically	1
adjusts	1
its	1
flight	1
so	1
that	1
both	1
eyes	1
become	1
equally	1
illumined;	1
in	1
doing	1
this	1
it	1
often	1
flies	1
into	1
the	1
candle.	1
It	1
may	1
seem	1
bad	1
business	1
that	1
the	1
moth	1
should	1
fly	1
into	1
the	1
candle,	1
but	1
the	1
flame	1
is	1
an	1
utterly	1
artificial	1
item	1
in	1
its	1
environment	1
to	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
expect	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
adapted.	1

§	1
2	1
Instinctive	1
Behaviour	1
On	1
a	1
higher	1
level	1
is	1
instinctive	1
behaviour,	1
which	1
reaches	1
such	1
remarkable	1
perfection	1
in	1
ants,	1
bees,	1
and	1
wasps.	1
In	1
its	1
typical	1
expression	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
depends	1
on	1
inborn	1
capacities;	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
to	1
be	1
learned;	1
it	1
is	1
independent	1
of	1
practice	1
or	1
experience,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
improved	1
by	1
both;	1
it	1
is	1
shared	1
equally	1
by	1
all	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sex	1
(for	1
the	1
female's	1
instincts	1
are	1
often	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
male's);	1
it	1
refers	1
to	1
particular	1
conditions	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
are	1
of	1
vital	1
importance,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
occur	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
lifetime.	1
The	1
female	1
Yucca	1
Moth	1
emerges	1
from	1
the	1
cocoon	1
when	1
the	1
Yucca	1
flower	1
puts	1
forth	1
its	1
bell-like	1
blossoms.	1
She	1
flies	1
to	1
a	1
flower,	1
collects	1
some	1
pollen	1
from	1
the	1
stamens,	1
kneads	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
pill-like	1
ball,	1
and	1
stows	1
this	1
away	1
under	1
her	1
chin.	1
She	1
flies	1
to	1
an	1
older	1
Yucca	1
flower	1
and	1
lays	1
her	1
eggs	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
ovules	1
within	1
the	1
seed-box,	1
but	1
before	1
she	1
does	1
so	1
she	1
has	1
to	1
deposit	1
on	1
the	1
stigma	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
pollen.	1
From	1
this	1
the	1
pollen-tubes	1
grow	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
pollen-nucleus	1
of	1
a	1
tube	1
fertilises	1
the	1
egg-cell	1
in	1
an	1
ovule,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
possible	1
seeds	1
become	1
real	1
seeds,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
fraction	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
Yucca	1
Moth	1
has	1
destroyed	1
by	1
using	1
them	1
as	1
cradles	1
for	1
her	1
eggs.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
Yucca	1
Moth	1
has	1
no	1
individual	1
experience	1
of	1
Yucca	1
flowers,	1
yet	1
she	1
secures	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
her	1
race	1
by	1
a	1
concatenation	1
of	1
actions	1
which	1
form	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
instinctive	1
repertory.	1
From	1
a	1
physiological	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
compound	1
reflex	1
actions,	1
but	1
in	1
some	1
cases,	1
at	1
least,	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
behaviour	1
is	1
suffused	1
with	1
awareness	1
and	1
backed	1
by	1
endeavour.	1
This	1
is	1
suggested	1
in	1
exceptional	1
cases	1
where	1
the	1
stereotyped	1
routine	1
is	1
departed	1
from	1
to	1
meet	1
exceptional	1
conditions.	1
It	1
should	1
also	1
be	1
noted	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
ants,	1
hive	1
bees,	1
and	1
wasps	1
exhibit	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
purely	1
instinctive	1
behaviour,	1
but	1
move	1
on	1
occasion	1
on	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
trial	1
and	1
error	1
or	1
of	1
experimental	1
initiative,	1
so	1
among	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals	1
the	1
intelligent	1
behaviour	1
is	1
sometimes	1
replaced	1
by	1
instinctive	1
routine.	1
Perhaps	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
without	1
a	1
spice	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
no	1
intelligent	1
behaviour	1
without	1
an	1
instinctive	1
element.	1
The	1
old	1
view	1
that	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
was	1
originally	1
intelligent,	1
and	1
that	1
instinct	1
is	1
"lapsed	1
intelligence,"	1
is	1
a	1
tempting	1
one,	1
and	1
is	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
habitual	1
intelligent	1
actions	1
cease	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
to	1
require	1
intelligent	1
control,	1
but	1
it	1
rests	1
on	1
the	1
unproved	1
hypothesis	1
that	1
the	1
acquisitions	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
can	1
be	1
entailed	1
on	1
the	1
race.	1
It	1
is	1
almost	1
certain	1
that	1
instinct	1
is	1
on	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
evolution	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
inborn	1
inspirations	1
of	1
the	1
calculating	1
boy	1
or	1
the	1
musical	1
genius	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
plodding	1
methods	1
of	1
intelligent	1
learning.	1
Animal	1
Intelligence	1
The	1
higher	1
reaches	1
of	1
the	1
inclined	1
plane	1
of	1
behaviour	1
show	1
intelligence	1
in	1
the	1
strict	1
sense.	1
They	1
include	1
those	1
kinds	1
of	1
behaviour	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
described	1
without	1
the	1
suggestion	1
that	1
the	1
animal	1
makes	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
perceptual	1
inference,	1
not	1
only	1
profiting	1
by	1
experience	1
but	1
learning	1
by	1
ideas.	1
Such	1
intelligent	1
actions	1
show	1
great	1
individual	1
variability;	1
they	1
are	1
plastic	1
and	1
adjustable	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
rarely	1
hinted	1
at	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
instincts	1
where	1
routine	1
cannot	1
be	1
departed	1
from	1
without	1
the	1
creature	1
being	1
nonplussed;	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
bound	1
up	1
with	1
particular	1
circumstances	1
as	1
instinctive	1
actions	1
are,	1
but	1
imply	1
an	1
appreciative	1
awareness	1
of	1
relations.	1
When	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
experimenting	1
with	1
general	1
ideas,	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
_conceptual_	1
as	1
contrasted	1
with	1
_perceptual_	1
inference,	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
Reason,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
evidence	1
of	1
this	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
man.	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
indeed,	1
always	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
credit	1
man	1
with	1
rational	1
conduct,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
it	1
ever	1
within	1
his	1
reach.	1
Animal	1
instinct	1
and	1
intelligence	1
will	1
be	1
illustrated	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
work.	1
We	1
are	1
here	1
concerned	1
simply	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
behaviour.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
tentative	1
experimental	1
behaviour	1
both	1
below	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
tactics	1
of	1
evolution	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
the	1
hereditary	1
enregistration	1
of	1
capacities	1
of	1
effective	1
response,	1
the	1
advantages	1
being	1
that	1
the	1
answers	1
come	1
more	1
rapidly	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
is	1
left	1
free,	1
if	1
it	1
chooses,	1
for	1
higher	1
adventures.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
big	1
fact	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
evolution	1
animals	1
have	1
shown	1
an	1
increasing	1
complexity	1
and	1
masterfulness	1
of	1
behaviour,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
at	1
once	1
more	1
controlled	1
and	1
more	1
definitely	1
free	1
agents,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
inner	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
behaviour--experimenting,	1
learning,	1
thinking,	1
feeling,	1
and	1
willing--has	1
come	1
to	1
count	1
for	1
more	1
and	1
more.	1
§	1

Evolution	1
of	1
Parental	1
Care	1
Mammals	1
furnish	1
a	1
crowning	1
instance	1
of	1
a	1
trend	1
of	1
evolution	1
which	1
expresses	1
itself	1
at	1
many	1
levels--the	1
tendency	1
to	1
bring	1
forth	1
the	1
young	1
at	1
a	1
well-advanced	1
stage	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
associated	1
with	1
a	1
decrease	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
offspring.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
British	1
starfish	1
called	1
_Luidia_	1
which	1
has	1
two	1
hundred	1
millions	1
of	1
eggs	1
in	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
several	1
millions	1
of	1
eggs	1
in	1
conger-eels	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
fishes.	1
These	1
illustrate	1
the	1
spawning	1
method	1
of	1
solving	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
survival.	1
Some	1
animals	1
are	1
naturally	1
prolific,	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
eggs	1
which	1
they	1
sow	1
broadcast	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
allows	1
for	1
enormous	1
infantile	1
mortality	1
and	1
obviates	1
any	1
necessity	1
for	1
parental	1
care.	1
But	1
some	1
other	1
creatures,	1
by	1
nature	1
less	1
prolific,	1
have	1
found	1
an	1
entirely	1
different	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem.	1
They	1
practise	1
parental	1
care	1
and	1
they	1
secure	1
survival	1
with	1
greatly	1
economised	1
reproduction.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
trend	1
of	1
evolution	1
particularly	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
animals.	1
So	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
Herbert	1
Spencer	1
formulated	1
the	1
generalisation	1
that	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
frequency	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
family	1
is	1
inverse	1
ratio	1
to	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
evolution	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
animal	1
has	1
attained.	1
Now	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
different	1
methods	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
which	1
secure	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
young,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
called	1
viviparity.	1
The	1
young	1
ones	1
are	1
not	1
liberated	1
from	1
the	1
parent	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
relatively	1
well	1
advanced	1
and	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
themselves.	1
This	1
gives	1
the	1
young	1
a	1
good	1
send-off	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
their	1
chances	1
of	1
death	1
are	1
greatly	1
reduced.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
animals	1
that	1
have	1
varied	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
economised	1
reproduction	1
may	1
keep	1
their	1
foothold	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
varied	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
parental	1
care.	1
In	1
other	1
cases	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
worked	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
round.	1
In	1
the	1
interesting	1
archaic	1
animal	1
called	1
_Peripatus_,	1
which	1
has	1
to	1
face	1
a	1
modern	1
world	1
too	1
severe	1
for	1
it,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
meeting	1
the	1
environing	1
difficulties	1
is	1
the	1
retention	1
of	1
the	1
offspring	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
within	1
the	1
mother,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
born	1
a	1
fully-formed	1
creature.	1
There	1
are	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
offspring	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
and,	1
although	1
there	1
are	1
exceptional	1
cases	1
like	1
the	1
summer	1
green-flies,	1
which	1
are	1
very	1
prolific	1
though	1
viviparous,	1
the	1
general	1
rule	1
is	1
that	1
viviparity	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
family.	1
The	1
case	1
of	1
flowering	1
plants	1
stands	1
by	1
itself,	1
for	1
although	1
they	1
illustrate	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
viviparity,	1
the	1
seed	1
being	1
embryos,	1
an	1
individual	1
plant	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
therefore	1
a	1
huge	1
family.	1
Viviparity	1
naturally	1
finds	1
its	1
best	1
illustrations	1
among	1
terrestrial	1
animals,	1
where	1
the	1
risks	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
life	1
are	1
many,	1
and	1
it	1
finds	1
its	1
climax	1
among	1
mammals.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
lowest	1
mammals,	1
the	1
Duckmole	1
and	1
two	1
Spiny	1
Ant-eaters,	1
lay	1
eggs,	1
i.e.	1
are	1
oviparous;	1
that	1
the	1
Marsupials,	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
grade,	1
bring	1
forth	1
their	1
young,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
prematurely,	1
and	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
stow	1
them	1
away	1
in	1
an	1
external	1
pouch;	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
others--the	1
Placentals--show	1
a	1
more	1
prolonged	1
ante-natal	1
life	1
and	1
an	1
intimate	1
partnership	1
between	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
unborn	1
young.	1
§	1
4	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
sublime	1
process	1
of	1
evolution.	1
It	1
has	1
implied	1
a	1
mastery	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
possible	1
haunts	1
of	1
life;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
progressive	1
conquest	1
of	1
the	1
environment.	1
1.	1
It	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
living	1
organisms	1
found	1
their	1
foothold	1
in	1
the	1
stimulating	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea--the	1
shallow	1
water,	1
brightly	1
illumined,	1
seaweed-growing	1
shelf	1
fringing	1
the	1
Continents.	1
This	1
littoral	1
zone	1
was	1
a	1
propitious	1
environment	1
where	1
sea	1
and	1
fresh	1
water,	1
earth	1
and	1
air	1
all	1
meet,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
stimulating	1
change,	1
abundant	1
oxygenation	1
and	1
a	1
copious	1
supply	1
of	1
nutritive	1
material	1
in	1
what	1
the	1
streams	1
bring	1
down	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
rich	1
seaweed	1
vegetation.	1

The	1
open-sea	1

pelagic	1
haunt	1
includes	1
all	1
the	1
brightly	1
illumined	1
surface	1
waters	1
beyond	1
the	1
shallow	1
water	1
of	1
the	1

It	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
easiest	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
haunts	1
of	1
life,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
crowding,	1
there	1
is	1
considerable	1
uniformity,	1
and	1
an	1
abundance	1
of	1
food	1
for	1
animals	1
is	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
inexhaustible	1
floating	1
"sea-meadows"	1
of	1
microscopic	1
AlgæThese	1
are	1
reincarnated	1
in	1
minute	1
animals	1
like	1
the	1
open-sea	1

which	1

are	1
utilised	1
by	1

turn	1
making	1
life	1
possible	1
for	1
higher	1
forms	1
like	1
carnivorous	1
turtles	1
and	1
toothed	1
whales.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
was	1
the	1
original	1
cradle	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
perhaps	1
Professor	1
Church	1
is	1
right	1
in	1
picturing	1
a	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
pelagic	1
life	1
before	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
sufficiently	1
shallow	1
water	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
floating	1
plants	1
to	1
anchor.	1
It	1
is	1
rather	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
this	1
view	1
that	1
many	1
shore	1
animals	1
such	1
as	1
crabs	1
and	1
starfishes,	1
spend	1
their	1
youthful	1
stages	1
in	1
the	1
relatively	1
safe	1
cradle	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
and	1
only	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
strenuous	1
conditions	1
of	1
their	1
birthplace	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
gained	1
considerable	1
strength	1
of	1
body.	1
It	1
is	1
probably	1
safe	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
original	1
cradle	1
of	1
life	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
open	1
sea.	1
The	1
Great	1
Deeps	1
3.	1
A	1
third	1
haunt	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
Deep	1
Sea,	1
the	1
abyssal	1
area,	1
which	1
occupies	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
region	1
of	1
extreme	1
cold--an	1
eternal	1
winter;	1
of	1
utter	1
darkness--an	1
eternal	1
night--relieved	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
fitful	1
gleams	1
of	1
"phosphorescent"	1
animals;	1
of	1
enormous	1
pressure--2-1/2	1
tons	1
on	1
the	1
square	1
inch	1
at	1
a	1
depth	1
of	1
2,500	1
fathoms;	1
of	1
profound	1
calm,	1
unbroken	1
silence,	1
immense	1
monotony.	1
And	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
plants	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
abysses,	1
the	1
animals	1
must	1
live	1
on	1
one	1
another,	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
run,	1
on	1
the	1
rain	1
of	1
moribund	1
animalcules	1
which	1
sink	1
from	1
the	1
surface	1
through	1
the	1
miles	1
of	1
water.	1
It	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
unpromising	1
haunt	1
of	1
life,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
abundantly	1
tenanted,	1
and	1
it	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
insurgent	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
creature	1
that	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
Deep	1
Sea	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
effectively	1
conquered.	1
It	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
colonising	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
abysses	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
relatively	1
recent	1
times,	1
for	1
the	1
fauna	1
does	1
not	1
include	1
many	1
very	1
antique	1
types.	1
It	1
is	1
practically	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
colonisation	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
littoral	1
animals	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
food-déis,	1
millennium	1
after	1
millennium,	1
further	1
and	1
further	1
down	1
the	1
long	1
slope	1
from	1
the	1
shore.	1
The	1
Freshwaters	1
4.	1
A	1
fourth	1
haunt	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
freshwaters,	1
including	1
river	1
and	1
lake,	1
pond	1
and	1
pool,	1
swamp	1
and	1
marsh.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
colonised	1
by	1
gradual	1
migration	1
up	1
estuaries	1
and	1
rivers,	1
or	1
by	1
more	1
direct	1
passage	1
from	1
the	1
seashore	1
into	1
the	1
brackish	1
swamp.	1
Or	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
that	1
partially	1
landlocked	1
corners	1
of	1
ancient	1
seas	1
became	1
gradually	1
turned	1
into	1
freshwater	1
basins.	1
The	1
animal	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
freshwaters	1
is	1
very	1
representative,	1
and	1
is	1
diversely	1
adapted	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
characteristic	1
contingencies--the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
dried	1
up,	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
frozen	1
hard	1
in	1
winter,	1
and	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
high	1
and	1
dry	1
after	1
floods	1
or	1
of	1
being	1
swept	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
Conquest	1
of	1
the	1
Dry	1
Land	1
5.	1
The	1
terrestrial	1
haunt	1
has	1
been	1
invaded	1
age	1
after	1
age	1
by	1
contingents	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
freshwaters.	1
We	1
must	1
recognise	1
the	1
worm	1
invasion,	1
which	1
led	1
eventually	1
to	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
the	1
fertile	1
soil,	1
the	1
invasion	1
due	1
to	1
air-breathing	1
Arthropods,	1
which	1
led	1
eventually	1
to	1
the	1
important	1
linkage	1
between	1
flowers	1
and	1
their	1
insect	1
visitors,	1
and	1
the	1
invasion	1
due	1
to	1
air-breathing	1
Amphibians,	1
which	1
led	1
eventually	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
terrestrial	1
animals	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
intelligence	1
and	1
family	1
affection.	1
Besides	1
these	1
three	1
great	1
invasions,	1
there	1
were	1
minor	1
ones	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
leading	1
to	1
land-snails,	1
for	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
widespread	1
and	1
persistent	1
tendency	1
among	1
aquatic	1
animals	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
dry	1
land.	1
Getting	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
had	1
a	1
manifold	1
significance.	1
It	1
implied	1
getting	1
into	1
a	1
medium	1
with	1
a	1
much	1
larger	1
supply	1
of	1
oxygen	1
than	1
there	1
is	1
dissolved	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
But	1
the	1
oxygen	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
capture,	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
skin	1
becomes	1
hard	1
or	1
well	1
protected,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
bound	1
to	1
become	1
in	1
animals	1
living	1
on	1
dry	1
ground.	1
Thus	1
this	1
leads	1
to	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
_internal	1
surfaces_,	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
lungs,	1
where	1
the	1
oxygen	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
body	1
may	1
be	1
absorbed	1
by	1
the	1
blood.	1
In	1
most	1
animals	1
the	1
blood	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
oxygen-capture;	1
but	1
in	1
insects	1
and	1
their	1
relatives	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
different	1
idea--of	1
taking	1
the	1
air	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
or	1
in	1
greater	1
part	1
to	1
the	1
area	1
of	1
oxygen-combustion,	1
the	1
living	1
tissues.	1
A	1
system	1
of	1
branching	1
air-tubes	1
takes	1
air	1
into	1
every	1
hole	1
and	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
insect's	1
body,	1
and	1
this	1
thorough	1
aeration	1
is	1
doubtless	1
in	1
part	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
insect's	1
intense	1
activity.	1
The	1
blood	1
never	1
becomes	1
impure.	1
The	1
conquest	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
also	1
implied	1
a	1
predominance	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
locomotion	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
punting,	1
when	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
pushed	1
along	1
by	1
pressing	1
a	1
lever	1
against	1
a	1
hard	1
substratum.	1
And	1
it	1
also	1
followed	1
that	1
with	1
few	1
exceptions	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
animal	1
tended	1
to	1
be	1
compact,	1
readily	1
lifted	1
off	1
the	1
ground	1
by	1
the	1
limbs	1
or	1
adjusted	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
large	1
a	1
surface	1
trailing	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
An	1
animal	1
like	1
a	1
jellyfish,	1
easily	1
supported	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
on	1
land.	1
Such	1
apparent	1
exceptions	1
as	1
earthworms,	1
centipedes,	1
and	1
snakes	1
are	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain,	1
for	1
the	1
earthworm	1
is	1
a	1
burrower	1
which	1
eats	1
its	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
soil,	1
the	1
centipede's	1
long	1
body	1
is	1
supported	1
by	1
numerous	1
hard	1
legs,	1
and	1
the	1
snake	1
pushes	1
itself	1
along	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
ventral	1
scales	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
lower	1
ends	1
of	1
very	1
numerous	1
ribs	1
are	1
attached.	1
Methods	1
of	1
Mastering	1
the	1
Difficulties	1
of	1
Terrestrial	1
Life	1
A	1
great	1
restriction	1
attendant	1
on	1
the	1
invasion	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
is	1
that	1
locomotion	1
becomes	1
limited	1
to	1
one	1
plane,	1
namely,	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
This	1
is	1
in	1
great	1
contrast	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
where	1
the	1
animal	1
can	1
move	1
up	1
or	1
down,	1
to	1
right	1
or	1
to	1
left,	1
at	1
any	1
angle	1
and	1
in	1
three	1
dimensions.	1
It	1
surely	1
follows	1
from	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
land	1
animals	1
must	1
be	1
rapid	1
and	1
precise,	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
safety	1
is	1
secured	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
way.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
most	1
land	1
animals	1
have	1
very	1
finely	1
developed	1
striped	1
muscles,	1
and	1
why	1
a	1
beetle	1
running	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
has	1
far	1
more	1
numerous	1
muscles	1
than	1
a	1
lobster	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
Land	1
animals	1
were	1
also	1
handicapped	1
by	1
the	1
risks	1
of	1
drought	1
and	1
of	1
frost,	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
defences	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
diverse	1
description,	1
from	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
woolly	1
caterpillars	1
to	1
the	1
fur	1
of	1
mammals,	1
from	1
the	1
carapace	1
of	1
tortoises	1
to	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
armadillos.	1
In	1
other	1
cases,	1
it	1
is	1
hardly	1
necessary	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
difficulties	1
may	1
be	1
met	1
in	1
other	1
ways,	1
as	1
frogs	1
meet	1
the	1
winter	1
by	1
falling	1
into	1
a	1
lethargic	1
state	1
in	1
some	1
secluded	1
retreat.	1
Another	1
consequence	1
of	1
getting	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
eggs	1
or	1
young	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
set	1
free	1
anyhow,	1
as	1
is	1
possible	1
when	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
surrounded	1
by	1
water,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
of	1
a	1
cradle.	1
If	1
the	1
eggs	1
were	1
laid	1
or	1
the	1
young	1
liberated	1
on	1
dry	1
ground,	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
many	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
dried	1
up	1
or	1
devoured.	1
So	1
there	1
are	1
numerous	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
land	1
animals	1
secure	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
their	1
young,	1
e.g.	1
by	1
burying	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
or	1
by	1
hiding	1
them	1
in	1
nests,	1
or	1
by	1
carrying	1
them	1
about	1
for	1
a	1
prolonged	1
period	1
either	1
before	1
or	1
after	1
birth.	1
This	1
may	1
mean	1
great	1
safety	1
for	1
the	1
young,	1
this	1
may	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
family,	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
tend	1
to	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
and	1
the	1
kindly	1
emotions.	1
Thus	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
many	1
far-reaching	1
consequences	1
have	1
followed.	1

Finally,	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
dwelling	1
on	1
the	1
risks	1
of	1
terrestrial	1
life,	1
because	1
they	1
enable	1
us	1
better	1
to	1
understand	1
why	1
so	1
many	1
land	1
animals	1
have	1
become	1
burrowers	1
and	1
others	1
climbers	1
of	1
trees,	1
why	1
some	1
have	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
others	1
have	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
air.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
perhaps,	1
why	1
the	1
land	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
colonised	1
at	1
all	1
when	1
the	1
risks	1
and	1
difficulties	1
are	1
so	1
great.	1
The	1
answer	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
necessity	1
and	1
curiosity	1
are	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
father	1
of	1
invention.	1
Animals	1
left	1
the	1
water	1
because	1
the	1
pools	1
dried	1
up,	1
or	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
overcrowded,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
inveterate	1
enemies,	1
but	1
also	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
curiosity	1
and	1
spirit	1
of	1
adventure	1
which,	1
from	1
first	1
to	1
last,	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
spurs	1
of	1
progress.	1
Conquering	1
the	1
Air	1
6.	1
The	1
last	1
great	1
haunt	1
of	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
air,	1
a	1
mastery	1
of	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
placed	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
insects,	1
Pterodactyls,	1
birds,	1
and	1
bats.	1
These	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
successes,	1
but	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
noted	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
many	1
brilliant	1
failures,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
attained	1
to	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
parachuting.	1
These	1
include	1
the	1
Flying	1
Fishes,	1
which	1
take	1
leaps	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
are	1
carried	1
for	1
many	1
yards	1
and	1
to	1
considerable	1
heights,	1
holding	1
their	1
enlarged	1
pectoral	1
fins	1
taut	1
or	1
with	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
slight	1
fluttering.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
so-called	1
Flying	1
Frog	1
(_Rhacophorus_)	1
that	1
skims	1
from	1
branch	1
to	1
branch,	1
and	1
the	1
much	1
more	1
effective	1
Flying	1
Dragon	1
(_Draco	1
volans_)	1
of	1
the	1
Far	1
East,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned	1
already.	1
Among	1
mammals	1
there	1
are	1
Flying	1
Phalangers,	1
Flying	1
Lemurs,	1
and	1
more	1
besides,	1
all	1
attaining	1
to	1
great	1
skill	1
as	1
parachutists,	1
and	1
illustrating	1
the	1
endeavour	1
to	1
master	1
the	1
air	1
which	1
man	1
has	1
realised	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
flight	1
brings	1
obvious	1
advantages.	1
A	1
bird	1
feeding	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
evade	1
the	1
stalking	1
carnivore	1
by	1
suddenly	1
rising	1
into	1
the	1
air;	1
food	1
and	1
water	1
can	1
be	1
followed	1
rapidly	1
and	1
to	1
great	1
distances;	1
the	1
eggs	1
or	1
the	1
young	1
can	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
safe	1
situations;	1
and	1
birds	1
in	1
their	1
migrations	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
brilliant	1
conquest	1
both	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
space.	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
know	1
no	1
winter	1
in	1
their	1
year,	1

flight	1

THE	1
PROCESSION	1
OF	1
LIFE	1
THROUGH	1
THE	1
AGES	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
Rock	1
Record	1
How	1
do	1
we	1
know	1
when	1
the	1
various	1
classes	1
of	1
animals	1
and	1
plants	1
were	1
established	1
on	1
the	1
earth?	1
How	1
do	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
their	1
appearance	1
and	1
the	1
succession	1
of	1
their	1
advances?	1
The	1
answer	1
is:	1
by	1
reading	1
the	1
Rock	1
Record.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
crust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
has	1
been	1
elevated	1
into	1
continents	1
and	1
depressed	1
into	1
ocean-troughs,	1
and	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
has	1
been	1
buckled	1
up	1
into	1
mountain	1
ranges	1
and	1
folded	1
in	1
gentler	1
hills	1
and	1
valleys.	1
The	1
high	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
have	1
been	1
weathered	1
by	1
air	1
and	1
water	1
in	1
many	1
forms,	1
and	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
weathering	1
have	1
been	1
borne	1
away	1
by	1
rivers	1
and	1
seas,	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
down	1
again	1
elsewhere	1
as	1
deposits	1
which	1
eventually	1
formed	1
sandstones,	1
mudstones,	1
and	1
similar	1
sedimentary	1
rocks.	1
Much	1
of	1
the	1
material	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
crust	1
has	1
thus	1
been	1
broken	1
down	1
and	1
worked	1
up	1
again	1
many	1
times	1
over,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
total	1
thickness	1
of	1
the	1
sedimentary	1
rocks	1
is	1
added	1
up	1
it	1
amounts,	1
according	1
to	1
some	1
geologists,	1
to	1
a	1
total	1
of	1
67	1
miles.	1
In	1
most	1
cases,	1
however,	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
thickness	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
for	1
the	1
deposits	1
were	1
usually	1
formed	1
in	1
limited	1
areas	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
time.	1

Fossils	1
When	1
the	1
sediments	1
were	1
accumulating	1
age	1
after	1
age,	1
it	1
naturally	1
came	1
about	1
that	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
living	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
were	1
buried,	1
and	1
these	1
formed	1
the	1
fossils	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
By	1
careful	1
piecing	1
together	1
of	1
evidence	1
the	1
geologist	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
determine	1
the	1
order	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
different	1
sedimentary	1
rocks	1
were	1
laid	1
down,	1
and	1
thus	1
to	1
say,	1
for	1
instance,	1
that	1
the	1
Devonian	1
period	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
Amphibians.	1
In	1
other	1
cases	1
the	1
geologist	1
utilises	1
the	1
fossils	1
in	1
his	1
attempt	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
strata	1
when	1
these	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
disarranged.	1
For	1
the	1
simpler	1
fossil	1
forms	1
of	1
any	1
type	1
must	1
be	1
older	1
than	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
more	1
complex.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
vicious	1
circle	1
here,	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
succession	1
of	1
strata	1
is	1
clear,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
fishes	1
before	1
there	1
were	1
amphibians,	1
and	1
amphibians	1
before	1
there	1
were	1
reptiles,	1
and	1
reptiles	1
before	1
there	1
were	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals.	1
In	1
certain	1
cases,	1
e.g.	1
of	1
fossil	1
horses	1
and	1
elephants,	1
the	1
actual	1
historical	1
succession	1
has	1
been	1
clearly	1
worked	1
out.	1
If	1
the	1
successive	1
strata	1
contained	1
good	1
samples	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
living	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
beds	1
were	1
formed,	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
but	1
many	1
animals	1
were	1
too	1
soft	1
to	1
become	1
satisfactory	1
fossils,	1
many	1
were	1
eaten	1
or	1
dissolved	1
away,	1
many	1
were	1
destroyed	1
by	1
heat	1
and	1
pressure,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
rock	1
record	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
library	1
very	1
much	1
damaged	1
by	1
fire	1

and	1
decay.	1

The	1
Geological	1
Time-table	1
The	1
long	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
its	1
inhabitants	1
is	1
conveniently	1
divided	1
into	1
eras.	1
Thus,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
ancient,	1
mediæl,	1
and	1
modern	1
history	1
of	1
mankind,	1
so	1
we	1
may	1
speak	1
of	1
Palæoic,	1
Mesozoic	1
and	1
Cenozoic	1
eras	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
a	1
whole.	1
Geologists	1
cannot	1
tell	1
us	1
except	1
in	1
an	1
approximate	1
way	1
how	1
long	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
evolution	1
has	1
taken.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
methods	1
is	1
to	1
estimate	1
how	1
long	1
has	1
been	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
accumulation	1
of	1
the	1
salts	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
have	1
been	1
dissolved	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
since	1
rain	1
began	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
Dividing	1
the	1
total	1
amount	1
of	1
saline	1
matter	1
by	1
what	1
is	1
contributed	1
every	1
year	1
in	1
modern	1
times,	1
we	1
get	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
million	1
years	1
as	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
present	1
rate	1
of	1
salt-accumulation	1
is	1
probably	1
much	1
greater	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
geological	1
periods,	1
the	1
prodigious	1
age	1
just	1
mentioned	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
far	1
below	1
the	1
mark.	1
Another	1
method	1
is	1
to	1
calculate	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
sedimentary	1
rocks,	1
like	1
sandstones	1
and	1
mudstones,	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
_total_	1
thickness	1
of	1
over	1
fifty	1
miles,	1
though	1
the	1
_local_	1
thickness	1
is	1
rarely	1
over	1
a	1
mile.	1
As	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
materials	1
have	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
weathering	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
crust,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
annual	1
amount	1
of	1
weathering	1
now	1
going	1
on	1
can	1
be	1
estimated,	1
the	1
time	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
sedimentary	1
rocks	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
be	1
approximately	1
calculated.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
other	1
ways	1
of	1
trying	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
earth's	1
age	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
successive	1
periods,	1
but	1
no	1
certainty	1
has	1
been	1
reached.	1
The	1
eras	1
marked	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
(page	1
92)	1
as	1
_before	1
the	1
Cambrian_	1
correspond	1
to	1
about	1
thirty-two	1
miles	1
of	1
thickness	1
of	1
strata;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
subsequent	1
eras	1
with	1
fossil-bearing	1
rocks	1
to	1
a	1
thickness	1
of	1
about	1
twenty-one	1
miles--in	1
itself	1
an	1
astounding	1
fact.	1
Perhaps	1
thirty	1
million	1
years	1
must	1
be	1
allotted	1
to	1
the	1
Pre-Cambrian	1
eras,	1
eighteen	1
to	1
the	1
Palæoic,	1
nine	1
to	1
the	1
Mesozoic,	1
three	1
to	1
the	1
Cenozoic,	1
making	1
a	1
grand	1
total	1
of	1
sixty	1
millions.	1
The	1
Establishment	1
of	1
Invertebrate	1
Stocks	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
astounding	1
fact	1
that	1
at	1
least	1
half	1
of	1
geological	1
time	1
(the	1
Archæoic	1
and	1
Proterozoic	1
eras)	1
passed	1
before	1
there	1
were	1
living	1
creatures	1
with	1
parts	1
sufficiently	1
hard	1
to	1
form	1
fossils.	1
In	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Proterozoic	1
era	1
there	1
are	1
traces	1
of	1
one-celled	1
marine	1
animals	1
(Radiolarians)	1
with	1
shells	1
of	1
flint,	1
and	1
of	1
worms	1
that	1
wallowed	1
in	1
the	1
primal	1
mud.	1
It	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
most	1
primitive	1
creatures	1
the	1
rock	1
record	1
tells	1
us	1
little.	1

it	1

also	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1

have	1
been	1
profoundly	1

repeatedly	1
changed	1

in	1
the	1
absence	1

extreme	1
rarity	1
of	1
fossils,	1
we	1
must	1
point	1
to	1
great	1
accumulations	1
of	1
limestone	1

indicate	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
calcareous	1

to	1
deposits	1

indicate	1
the	1
activity	1

§	1
3	1
The	1
Era	1
of	1
Ancient	1
Life	1
(Palæoic)	1
The	1
_Cambrian_	1
period	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
stocks	1
of	1
backboneless	1
animals	1
such	1
as	1
sponges,	1
jellyfishes,	1
worms,	1
sea-cucumbers,	1
lamp-shells,	1
trilobites,	1
crustaceans,	1
and	1
molluscs.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
eloquent	1
in	1
the	1
broad	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
peopling	1
of	1
the	1
seas	1
had	1
definitely	1
begun	1
some	1
thirty	1
million	1
years	1
ago,	1
for	1
Professor	1
H.	1
F.	1
Osborn	1
points	1
out	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
Cambrian	1
period	1
there	1
was	1
already	1
a	1
colonisation	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
waters.	1
The	1
_Ordovician_	1
period	1
was	1
marked	1
by	1
abundant	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
once	1
very	1
successful	1
class	1
of	1
Trilobites--jointed-footed,	1
antenna-bearing,	1
segmented	1
marine	1
animals,	1
with	1
numerous	1
appendages	1
and	1
a	1
covering	1
of	1
chitin.	1
They	1
died	1
away	1
entirely	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Palæoic	1
era.	1
Also	1
very	1
notable	1
was	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
predatory	1
cuttlefishes,	1
the	1
bullies	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
seas.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
period	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
backboned	1
animals	1
made	1
their	1
appearance--an	1
epoch-making	1
step	1
in	1
evolution.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
true	1
fishes	1
were	1
evolved--destined	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
ages	1
to	1
replace	1
the	1
cuttlefishes	1
(which	1
are	1
mere	1
molluscs)	1
in	1
dominating	1
the	1
seas.	1

three	1

number,	1
one	1
in	1
Queensland,	1
one	1

one	1

extremely	1

the	1

highly	1

that	1
the	1

should	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
some	1
adventurous	1
worms,	1
but	1
the	1
second	1
great	1

was	1
certainly	1
due	1
to	1
air-breathing	1
Arthropods,	1

the	1

we	1

The	1
_Devonian_	1
period,	1
including	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
significant	1
periods	1
in	1
the	1
earth's	1
history.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
flowering	1
plants	1
upon	1
the	1

of	1

of	1
the	1

probably	1
from	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1

it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1

next	1

that	1
they	1
came	1
to	1

While	1
they	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
remarkable	1
exuberance	1
of	1

heavily	1

in	1

EVOLUTION	1
OF	1
LAND	1
ANIMALS	1
§	1
1	1
Giant	1
Amphibians	1
and	1
Coal-measures	1
The	1
_Carboniferous_	1
period	1
was	1
marked	1
by	1
a	1
mild	1
moist	1
climate	1
and	1
a	1
luxuriant	1
vegetation	1
in	1
the	1
swampy	1
low	1
grounds.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
much	1
less	1
strenuous	1
time	1
than	1
the	1
Devonian	1
period;	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
summer.	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
type	1
we	1
see	1
now,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
forests	1
of	1
club-mosses	1
and	1
horsetails	1
which	1
grew	1
to	1
a	1
gigantic	1
size	1
compared	1
with	1
their	1
pigmy	1
representatives	1
of	1
to-day.	1
In	1
these	1
forests	1
the	1
jointed-footed	1
invaders	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
ran	1
riot	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
centipedes,	1
spiders,	1
scorpions,	1
and	1
insects,	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
the	1
primeval	1
Amphibians	1
fed.	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
insects	1
made	1
possible	1
a	1
new	1
linkage	1
of	1
far-reaching	1
importance,	1
namely,	1
the	1
cross-fertilisation	1
of	1
flowering	1
plants	1
by	1
their	1
insect	1
visitors,	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
onwards	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
flowers	1
and	1
their	1
visitors	1
have	1
evolved	1
hand	1
in	1
hand.	1
Cross-fertilisation	1
is	1
much	1
surer	1
by	1
insects	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
wind,	1
and	1
cross-fertilisation	1
is	1
more	1
advantageous	1
than	1
self-fertilisation	1
because	1
it	1
promotes	1
both	1
fertility	1
and	1
plasticity.	1
It	1
was	1
probably	1
in	1
this	1
period	1
that	1
_coloured_	1
flowers--attractive	1
to	1
insect-visitors--began	1
to	1
justify	1
themselves	1
as	1
beauty	1
became	1
useful,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
monotonous	1
green	1
of	1
the	1
horsetail	1
and	1
club-moss	1
forests,	1
which	1
covered	1
great	1
tracts	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years.	1
In	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
forests	1
there	1
were	1
also	1
land-snails,	1
representing	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
minor	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
tending	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
check	1
vegetation.	1
They,	1
too,	1
were	1
probably	1
preyed	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
Amphibians,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
attained	1
a	1
large	1
size.	1
Each	1
age	1
has	1
had	1
its	1
giants,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
were	1
Amphibians	1
called	1
Labyrinthodonts,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
almost	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
donkeys.	1
It	1
need	1
hardly	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
period	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
Coal-measures	1
were	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
immense	1
accumulation	1
of	1
the	1
spores	1
and	1
debris	1
of	1
the	1
club-moss	1
forests.	1
Ages	1
afterwards,	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
man	1
to	1
tap	1
this	1
great	1
source	1
of	1
energy--traceable	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sunshine	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
ago.	1
Even	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
no	1
plant	1
or	1
animal	1
lives	1
or	1
dies	1
to	1
itself!	1
The	1
Acquisitions	1
of	1
Amphibians.	1
As	1
Amphibians	1
had	1
their	1
Golden	1
Age	1
in	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
period	1
we	1
may	1
fitly	1
use	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
indicating	1
the	1
advances	1
in	1
evolution	1
which	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
Amphibians	1
implied.	1
(1)	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
the	1
passage	1
from	1
water	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
higher	1
and	1
more	1
promiseful	1
life,	1
taxed	1
no	1
doubt	1
by	1
increased	1
difficulties.	1
The	1
natural	1
question	1
rises	1
why	1
animals	1
should	1
have	1
migrated	1
from	1
water	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
at	1
all	1
when	1
great	1
difficulties	1
were	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
transition.	1
The	1
answers	1
must	1
be:	1
(_a_)	1
that	1
local	1
drying	1
up	1
of	1
water-basins	1
or	1
elevations	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
surface	1
often	1
made	1
the	1
old	1
haunts	1
untenable;	1
(_b_)	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
great	1
congestion	1
and	1
competition	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
quarters;	1
and	1
(_c_)	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
undeniable	1
endeavour	1
after	1
well-being	1
throughout	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
animal	1
life.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
with	1
mankind,	1
migrations	1
were	1
prompted	1
by	1
the	1
setting	1
in	1
of	1
prolonged	1
drought,	1
by	1
over-population,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
adventure.	1
(2)	1
In	1
Amphibians	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
non-digitate	1
paired	1
fins	1
of	1
fishes	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
limbs	1
with	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes.	1
This	1
implied	1
an	1
advantageous	1
power	1
of	1
grasping,	1
of	1
holding	1
firm,	1
of	1
putting	1
food	1
into	1
the	1
mouth,	1
of	1
feeling	1
things	1
in	1
three	1
dimensions.	1
(3)	1
We	1
cannot	1
be	1
positive	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
soft	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
Amphibians	1
known	1
only	1
as	1
fossils,	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way	1
like	1
the	1
frogs	1
and	1
toads,	1
newts	1
and	1
salamanders	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
made	1
among	1
other	1
acquisitions	1
the	1
following:	1
true	1
ventral	1
lungs,	1
a	1
three-chambered	1
heart,	1
a	1
movable	1
tongue,	1
a	1
drum	1
to	1
the	1
ear,	1
and	1
lids	1
to	1
the	1
eyes.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
tadpole	1
has	1
some	1
muscle-fibres	1
in	1
it,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
effect	1
movement,	1
recalling	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
fishes,	1
which	1
has	1
not	1
any	1
muscles	1
at	1
all.	1
Gradually,	1
as	1
the	1
tadpole	1
becomes	1
a	1
frog,	1
the	1
muscle-fibres	1
grow	1
in	1
strength,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
full-grown	1
creature	1
to	1
shoot	1
out	1
its	1
tongue	1
upon	1
insects.	1
This	1
is	1
probably	1
a	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
accomplished	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
millennia	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Amphibian	1
race.	1
(4)	1
Another	1
acquisition	1
made	1
by	1
Amphibians	1
was	1
a	1
voice,	1
due,	1
as	1
in	1
ourselves,	1
to	1
the	1
rapid	1
passage	1
of	1
air	1
over	1
taut	1
membranes	1
(vocal	1
cords)	1
stretched	1
in	1
the	1
larynx.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
fact	1
that	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
there	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
no	1
sound	1
of	1
life	1
at	1
all,	1
only	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
wind	1
and	1
wave,	1
thunder	1
and	1
avalanche.	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
instrumental	1
music	1
of	1
some	1
insects,	1
perhaps	1
beginning	1
in	1
the	1
Carboniferous,	1
the	1
first	1
vital	1
sounds	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
Amphibians,	1
and	1
theirs	1
certainly	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
voice--surely	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
steps	1
in	1
organic	1
evolution.	1

swims	1
well	1

feeds	1
on	1
small	1
water-animals.	1
It	1
can	1
also	1
burrow.]	1
Evolution	1
of	1
the	1
Voice	1
The	1
first	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
probably	1
that	1
indicated	1
by	1
our	1
frogs	1
and	1
toads--it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
sex-call.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
trumpeting	1
with	1
which	1
frogs	1
herald	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
males	1
that	1
the	1
voice	1
is	1
well	1
developed.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
look	1
forward,	1
past	1
Amphibians	1
altogether,	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
voice	1
becoming	1
a	1
maternal	1
call	1
helping	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
young--a	1
use	1
very	1
obvious	1
when	1
young	1
birds	1
squat	1
motionless	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
parent's	1
danger-note.	1
Later	1
on,	1
probably,	1
the	1
voice	1
became	1
an	1
infantile	1
call,	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
unhatched	1
crocodile	1
pipes	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
deeply	1
buried	1
egg,	1
signalling	1
to	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
unearthed.	1
Higher	1
still	1
the	1
voice	1
expresses	1
emotion,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
birds,	1
often	1
outside	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
breeding	1
time.	1
Later	1
still,	1
particular	1
sounds	1
become	1
words,	1
signifying	1
particular	1
things	1
or	1
feelings,	1
such	1
as	1
"food,"	1
"danger,"	1
"home,"	1
"anger,"	1
and	1
"joy."	1
Finally	1
words	1
become	1
a	1
medium	1
of	1
social	1
intercourse	1
and	1
as	1
symbols	1
help	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
man	1
to	1
reason.	1
§	1
2	1
The	1
Early	1
Reptiles	1
In	1
the	1
_Permian_	1
period	1
reptiles	1
appeared,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
one	1
should	1
say,	1
began	1
to	1
assert	1
themselves.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
emergence	1
of	1
backboned	1
animals	1
which	1
were	1
free	1
from	1
water	1
and	1
relinquished	1
the	1
method	1
of	1
breathing	1
by	1
gills,	1
which	1
Amphibians	1
retained	1
in	1
their	1
young	1
stages	1
at	1
least.	1
The	1
unhatched	1
or	1
unborn	1
reptile	1
breathes	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
vascular	1
hood	1
spread	1
underneath	1
the	1
egg-shell	1
and	1
absorbing	1
dry	1
air	1
from	1
without.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
point	1
that	1
this	1
vascular	1
hood,	1
called	1
the	1
allantois,	1
is	1
represented	1
in	1
the	1
Amphibians	1
by	1
an	1
unimportant	1
bladder	1
growing	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
hind	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
food-canal.	1
A	1
great	1
step	1
in	1
evolution	1
was	1
implied	1
in	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
this	1
ante-natal	1
hood	1
or	1
foetal	1
membrane	1
and	1
another	1
one--of	1
protective	1
significance--called	1
the	1
amnion,	1
which	1
forms	1
a	1
water-bag	1
over	1
the	1
delicate	1
embryo.	1
The	1
step	1
meant	1
total	1
emancipation	1
from	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
from	1
gill-breathing,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
foetal	1
membranes,	1
the	1
amnion	1
and	1
the	1
allantois,	1
persist	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
all	1
reptiles	1
but	1
in	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals	1
as	1
well.	1
These	1
higher	1
Vertebrates	1
are	1
therefore	1
called	1
Amniota	1
in	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
Lower	1
Vertebrates	1
or	1
Anamnia	1
(the	1
Amphibians,	1
Fishes,	1
and	1
primitive	1
types).	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
suggestive	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
embryos	1
of	1
all	1
reptiles,	1
birds,	1
and	1
mammals	1
show	1
gill-clefts--_a	1
tell-tale	1
evidence	1
of	1
their	1
distant	1
aquatic	1
ancestry_.	1
But	1
these	1
embryonic	1
gill-clefts	1
are	1
not	1
used	1
for	1
respiration	1
and	1
show	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
gills	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
embryonic	1
reptiles	1
and	1
birds	1
where	1
their	1
dwindled	1
vestiges	1
have	1
been	1
recently	1
discovered.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
gill-clefts,	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
higher	1
Vertebrates	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
becomes	1
the	1
Eustachian	1
tube	1
leading	1
from	1
the	1
ear-passage	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
mouth.	1
The	1
reason	1
why	1
they	1
persist	1
when	1
only	1
one	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
use,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
transformed	1
guise,	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
interpret	1
except	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
Evolution	1
theory.	1
They	1
illustrate	1
the	1
lingering	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
pedigree,	1
the	1
living	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
the	1
tendency	1
that	1
individual	1
development	1
has	1
to	1
recapitulate	1
racial	1
evolution.	1
In	1
a	1
condensed	1
and	1
telescoped	1
manner,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
what	1
took	1
the	1
race	1
a	1
million	1
years	1
may	1
be	1
recapitulated	1
by	1
the	1
individual	1
in	1
a	1
week!	1
In	1
the	1
Permian	1
period	1
the	1
warm	1
moist	1
climate	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
period	1
was	1
replaced	1
by	1
severe	1
conditions,	1
culminating	1
in	1
an	1
Ice	1
Age	1
which	1
spread	1
from	1
the	1
Southern	1
Hemisphere	1
throughout	1
the	1
world.	1
With	1
this	1
was	1
associated	1
a	1
waning	1
of	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
flora,	1
and	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
one,	1
consisting	1
of	1
ferns,	1
conifers,	1
ginkgos,	1
and	1
cycads,	1
which	1
persisted	1
until	1
near	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Mesozoic	1
era.	1
The	1
Permian	1
Ice	1
Age	1
lasted	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years,	1
and	1
was	1
most	1
severe	1
in	1
the	1
Far	1
South.	1
Of	1
course,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
world	1
then,	1
for	1
North	1
Europe	1
was	1
joined	1
to	1
North	1
America,	1
Africa	1
to	1
South	1
America,	1
and	1
Australia	1
to	1
Asia.	1
It	1
was	1
probably	1
during	1
the	1
Permian	1
Ice	1
Age	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
insects	1
divided	1
their	1
life-history	1
into	1
two	1
main	1
chapters--the	1
feeding,	1
growing,	1
moulting,	1
immature,	1
larval	1
stages,	1
e.g.	1
caterpillars,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
ascetic,	1
non-growing,	1
non-moulting,	1
winged	1
phase,	1
adapted	1
for	1
reproduction.	1
Between	1
these	1
there	1
intervened	1
the	1
quiescent,	1
well-protected	1
pupa	1
stage	1
or	1
chrysalis,	1
probably	1
adapted	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
of	1
surviving	1
the	1
severe	1
winter.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
an	1
animal	1
to	1
survive	1
when	1
the	1
vital	1
processes	1
are	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
in	1
abeyance.	1
Disappearance	1
of	1
many	1
Ancient	1
Types	1
We	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
last	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
Palæoic	1
era	1
and	1
its	1
prolonged	1
ice	1
age	1
without	1
noticing	1
that	1
it	1
meant	1
the	1
entire	1
cessation	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
ancient	1
types,	1
especially	1
among	1
plants	1
and	1
backboneless	1
animals,	1
which	1
now	1
disappear	1
for	1
ever.	1
It	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
animals	1
of	1
ancient	1
days	1
stand	1
in	1
three	1
different	1
relations	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
to-day.	1
(_a_)	1
There	1
are	1
ancient	1
types	1
that	1
have	1
living	1
representatives,	1
sometimes	1
few	1
and	1
sometimes	1
many,	1
sometimes	1
much	1
changed	1
and	1
sometimes	1
but	1
slightly	1
changed.	1
The	1
lamp-shell,	1
_Lingulella_,	1
of	1
the	1
Cambrian	1
and	1
Ordovician	1
period	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
near	1
relative	1
in	1
the	1
_Lingula_	1
of	1
to-day.	1
There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
extremely	1
conservative	1
animals.	1
(_b_)	1
There	1
are	1
ancient	1
types	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
living	1
representatives,	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
guise	1
of	1
transformed	1
descendants,	1
as	1
the	1
King-crab	1
(_Limulus_)	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
transformed	1
descendant	1
of	1
the	1
otherwise	1
quite	1
extinct	1
race	1
to	1
which	1
Eurypterids	1
or	1
Sea-scorpions	1
belonged.	1
(_c_)	1
There	1
are	1
altogether	1
extinct	1
types--_lost	1
races_--which	1
have	1
left	1
not	1
a	1
wrack	1
behind.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
representation	1
to-day	1
of	1
such	1
races	1
as	1
Graptolites	1
and	1
Trilobites.	1
Looking	1
backwards	1
over	1
the	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
comprised	1
in	1
the	1
Palæoic	1
era,	1
what	1
may	1
we	1
emphasise	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
salient	1
features?	1
There	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
_Cambrian_	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
classes	1
of	1
backboneless	1
animals;	1
in	1
the	1
_Ordovician_	1
the	1
first	1
fishes	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
first	1
terrestrial	1
plants;	1
in	1
the	1
_Silurian_	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
air-breathing	1
Invertebrates	1
and	1
mud-fishes;	1
in	1
the	1
_Devonian_	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Amphibians,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
higher	1
land	1
animals	1
are	1
descended,	1
and	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
land	1
flora;	1
in	1
the	1
_Carboniferous_	1
the	1
great	1
Club-moss	1
forests	1
and	1
an	1
exuberance	1
of	1
air-breathing	1
insects	1
and	1
their	1
allies;	1
in	1
the	1
_Permian_	1
the	1
first	1
reptiles	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
flora.	1
THE	1
GEOLOGICAL	1
MIDDLE	1
AGES	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
Mesozoic	1
Era	1
In	1
a	1
broad	1
way	1
the	1
Mesozoic	1
era	1
corresponds	1
with	1
the	1
Golden	1
Age	1
of	1
reptiles,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
the	1
Conifer	1
and	1
Cycad	1
flora,	1
which	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
Permian.	1
But	1
among	1
the	1
Conifers	1
and	1
Cycads	1
our	1
modern	1
flowering	1
plants	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
show	1
face	1
tentatively,	1
just	1
like	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals	1
among	1
the	1
great	1
reptiles.	1
In	1
the	1
_Triassic_	1
period	1
the	1
exuberance	1
of	1
reptilian	1
life	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
Permian	1
was	1
continued.	1
Besides	1
Turtles	1
which	1
still	1
persist,	1
there	1
were	1
Ichthyosaurs,	1
Plesiosaurs,	1
Dinosaurs,	1
and	1
Pterosaurs,	1
none	1
of	1
which	1
lasted	1
beyond	1
the	1
Mesozoic	1
era.	1
Of	1
great	1
importance	1
was	1
the	1
rise	1
of	1
the	1
Dinosaurs	1
in	1
the	1
Triassic,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
this	1
vigorous	1
and	1
plastic	1
stock--some	1
of	1
them	1
bipeds--we	1
must	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
ancestors	1
of	1
both	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals.	1
Both	1
land	1
and	1
water	1
were	1
dominated	1
by	1
reptiles,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
attained	1
to	1
gigantic	1
size.	1
Had	1
there	1
been	1
any	1
zoologist	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
sagacious	1
indeed	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
suspected	1
that	1
reptiles	1
did	1
not	1
represent	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
creation.	1
The	1
Flying	1
Dragons	1
The	1
_Jurassic_	1
period	1
showed	1
a	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
reptilian	1
splendour.	1
They	1
radiated	1
in	1
many	1
directions,	1
becoming	1
adapted	1
to	1
many	1
haunts.	1
Thus	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
Fish	1
Lizards	1
paddling	1
in	1
the	1
seas,	1
many	1
types	1
of	1
terrestrial	1
dragons	1
stalking	1
about	1
on	1
land,	1
many	1
swiftly	1
gliding	1
alligator-like	1
forms,	1
and	1
the	1
Flying	1
Dragons	1
which	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
Triassic	1
attained	1
to	1
remarkable	1
success	1
and	1
variety.	1
Their	1
wing	1
was	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
fold	1
of	1
skin	1
on	1
the	1
enormously	1
elongated	1
outermost	1
finger,	1
and	1
they	1
varied	1
from	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
sparrow	1
to	1
a	1
spread	1
of	1
over	1
five	1
feet.	1
A	1
soldering	1
of	1
the	1
dorsal	1
vertebræs	1
in	1
our	1
Flying	1
Birds	1
was	1
an	1
adaptation	1
to	1
striking	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
some	1
force,	1
but	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
slight	1
keel,	1
if	1
any,	1
on	1
the	1
breast-bone,	1
it	1
is	1
unlikely	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
fly	1
far.	1
For	1
we	1
know	1
from	1
our	1
modern	1
birds	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
flight	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
gauged	1
from	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
keel,	1
which	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
great	1
ridge	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
insertion	1
of	1
the	1
muscles	1
of	1
flight.	1
It	1
is	1
absent,	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
the	1
Running	1
Birds,	1
like	1
the	1
ostrich,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
degenerated	1
in	1
an	1
interesting	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
burrowing	1
parrot	1
(_Stringops_)	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
other	1
birds	1
that	1
have	1
"gone	1
back."	1
The	1
First	1
Known	1
Bird	1
But	1
the	1
Jurassic	1
is	1
particularly	1
memorable	1
because	1
its	1
strata	1
have	1
yielded	1
two	1
fine	1
specimens	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
known	1
bird,	1
_Archæteryx_.	1
These	1
were	1
entombed	1
in	1
the	1
deposits	1
which	1
formed	1
the	1
fine-grained	1
lithographic	1
stones	1
of	1
Bavaria,	1
and	1
practically	1
every	1
bone	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
preserved	1
except	1
the	1
breast-bone.	1
Even	1
the	1
feathers	1
have	1
left	1
their	1
marks	1
with	1
distinctness.	1
This	1
oldest	1
known	1
bird--too	1
far	1
advanced	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
bird--was	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
crow	1
and	1
was	1
probably	1
of	1
arboreal	1
habits.	1
Of	1
great	1
interest	1
are	1
its	1
reptilian	1
features,	1
so	1
pronounced	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
evade	1
the	1
evolutionist	1
suggestion.	1
It	1
had	1
teeth	1
in	1
both	1
jaws,	1
which	1
no	1
modern	1
bird	1
has;	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
long	1
lizard-like	1
tail,	1
which	1
no	1
modern	1
bird	1
has;	1
it	1
had	1
claws	1
on	1
three	1
fingers,	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
half-made	1
wing.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
show,	1
what	1
all	1
modern	1
birds	1
show,	1
a	1
fusion	1
of	1
half	1
the	1
wrist-bones	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
palm-bones,	1
the	1
well-known	1
carpo-metacarpus	1
bone	1
which	1
forms	1
a	1
basis	1
for	1
the	1
longest	1
pinions.	1
In	1
many	1
reptiles,	1
such	1
as	1
Crocodiles,	1
there	1
are	1
peculiar	1
bones	1
running	1
across	1
the	1
abdomen	1
beneath	1
the	1
skin,	1
the	1
so-called	1
"abdominal	1
ribs,"	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
an	1
eloquent	1
detail	1
to	1
find	1
these	1
represented	1
in	1
_Archæteryx_,	1
the	1
earliest	1
known	1
bird.	1
No	1
modern	1
bird	1
shows	1
any	1
trace	1
of	1
them.	1

There	1
is	1
no	1
warrant	1
for	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
flying	1
reptiles	1
or	1
Pterodactyls	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
birds,	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
groups	1
are	1
on	1
different	1
lines,	1
and	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
wings	1
is	1
entirely	1
different.	1
Thus	1
the	1
long-fingered	1
Pterodactyl	1
wing	1
was	1
a	1
parachute	1
wing,	1
while	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
bird's	1
wing	1
has	1
its	1
centre	1
in	1
the	1
feathers.	1
It	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
birds	1
evolved	1
from	1
certain	1
Dinosaurs	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
bipeds,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
swift	1
runners	1
that	1
took	1
"flying	1
jumps"	1
along	1
the	1
ground.	1
Thereafter,	1
perhaps,	1
came	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship	1
during	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
gliding	1
from	1
tree	1
to	1
tree	1
before	1
true	1
flight	1
was	1
achieved.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
flight	1
has	1
been	1
solved	1
four	1
times	1
among	1
animals--by	1
insects,	1
by	1
Pterodactyls,	1
by	1
birds,	1
and	1
by	1
bats;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
four	1
solutions	1
are	1
on	1
entirely	1
different	1
lines.	1
In	1
the	1
_Cretaceous_	1
period	1
the	1
outstanding	1
events	1
included	1
the	1
waning	1
of	1
giant	1
reptiles,	1
the	1
modernising	1
of	1
the	1
flowering	1
plants,	1
and	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
small	1
mammals.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
Permian	1
reptiles,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
dog-toothed	1
Cynodonts,	1
were	1
extraordinarily	1
mammal-like,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
probably	1
from	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
definite	1
mammals	1
emerged	1
in	1
the	1
Triassic.	1
Comparatively	1
little	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
Triassic	1
mammals	1
save	1
that	1
their	1
back-teeth	1
were	1
marked	1
by	1
numerous	1
tubercles	1
on	1
the	1
crown,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
gaining	1
strength	1
in	1
the	1
late	1
Triassic	1
when	1
small	1
arboreal	1
insectivores,	1
not	1
very	1
distant	1
from	1
the	1
modern	1
tree-shrews	1
(_Tupaia_),	1
began	1
to	1
branch	1
out	1
in	1
many	1
directions	1
indicative	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
divisions	1
of	1
modern	1
mammals,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
clawed	1
mammals,	1
hoofed	1
mammals,	1
and	1
the	1
race	1
of	1
monkeys	1
or	1
Primates.	1
In	1
the	1
Upper	1
Cretaceous	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
exuberant	1
"radiation"	1
of	1
mammals,	1
adaptive	1
to	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
haunts,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
vigorously	1
continued	1
in	1
Tertiary	1
times.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
earliest	1
remains	1
of	1
definite	1
mammals	1
in	1
the	1
Triassic	1
precede	1
the	1
first-known	1
bird	1
in	1
the	1
Jurassic.	1
For	1
although	1
we	1
usually	1
rank	1
mammals	1
as	1
higher	1
than	1
birds	1
(being	1
mammals	1
ourselves,	1
how	1
could	1
we	1
do	1
otherwise?),	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
birds	1
are	1
pre-eminent,	1
e.g.	1
in	1
skeleton,	1
musculature,	1
integumentary	1
structures,	1
and	1
respiratory	1
system.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals	1
are	1
on	1
two	1
quite	1
different	1
tacks	1
of	1
evolution,	1
not	1
related	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
save	1
in	1
having	1
a	1
common	1
ancestry	1
in	1
extinct	1
reptiles.	1
Moreover,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
Jurassic	1
_Archæteryx_	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
bird	1
in	1
any	1
sense	1
except	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
any	1
record.	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
safe	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
birds	1
came	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
before	1
mammals	1
did.	1
Looking	1
backwards,	1
we	1
may	1
perhaps	1
sum	1
up	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
essential	1
in	1
the	1
Mesozoic	1
era	1
in	1
Professor	1
Schuchert's	1
sentence:	1
"The	1
Mesozoic	1
is	1
the	1
Age	1
of	1
Reptiles,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
little	1
mammals	1
and	1
the	1
toothed	1
birds	1
are	1
storing	1
up	1
intelligence	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
replace	1
the	1
reptiles	1
when	1
the	1
cycads	1
and	1
conifers	1
shall	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
flowering	1
plants."	1
§	1
2	1
The	1
Cenozoic	1
or	1
Tertiary	1
Era	1
In	1
the	1
_Eocene_	1
period	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
replacement	1
of	1
the	1
small-brained	1
archaic	1
mammals	1
by	1
big-brained	1
modernised	1
types,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
associated	1
the	1
covering	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
grass	1
and	1
dry	1
pasture.	1
Marshes	1
were	1
replaced	1
by	1
meadows	1
and	1
browsing	1
by	1
grazing	1
mammals.	1
In	1
the	1
spreading	1
meadows	1
an	1
opportunity	1
was	1
also	1
offered	1
for	1
a	1
richer	1
evolution	1
of	1
insects	1
and	1
birds.	1
During	1
the	1
_Oligocene_	1
the	1
elevation	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
continued,	1
the	1
climate	1
became	1
much	1
less	1
moist,	1
and	1
the	1
grazing	1
herds	1
extended	1
their	1
range.	1
The	1
_Miocene_	1
was	1
the	1
mammalian	1
Golden	1
Age	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
crowning	1
examples	1
of	1
what	1
Osborn	1
calls	1
"adaptive	1
radiation."	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
mammals,	1
like	1
the	1
reptiles	1
before	1
them,	1
conquer	1
every	1
haunt	1
of	1
life.	1
There	1
are	1
flying	1
bats,	1
volplaning	1
parachutists,	1
climbers	1
in	1
trees	1
like	1
sloths	1
and	1
squirrels,	1
quickly	1
moving	1
hoofed	1
mammals,	1
burrowers	1
like	1
the	1
moles,	1
freshwater	1
mammals,	1
like	1
duckmole	1
and	1
beaver,	1
shore-frequenting	1
seals	1
and	1
manatees,	1
and	1
open-sea	1
cetaceans,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
dive	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
full	1
fathoms	1
five.	1
It	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
realise	1
the	1
perennial	1
tendency	1
of	1
animals	1
to	1
conquer	1
every	1
corner	1
and	1
to	1
fill	1
every	1
niche	1
of	1
opportunity,	1
and	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
successive	1
sets	1
of	1
animals	1
in	1
succeeding	1
ages.	1
_Most	1
notably	1
the	1
mammals	1
repeat	1
all	1
the	1
experiments	1
of	1
reptiles	1
on	1
a	1
higher	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
spiral._	1
Thus	1
arises	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
convergence,	1
the	1
superficial	1
resemblance	1
of	1
unrelated	1
types,	1
like	1
whales	1
and	1
fishes,	1
the	1
resemblance	1
being	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
different	1
types	1
are	1
similarly	1
adapted	1
to	1
similar	1
conditions	1
of	1
life.	1
Professor	1
H.	1
F.	1
Osborn	1
points	1
out	1
that	1
mammals	1
may	1
seek	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
different	1
habitat-zones,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
six	1
quite	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
food.	1
Living	1
creatures	1
penetrate	1
everywhere	1
like	1
the	1
overflowing	1
waters	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
river	1
in	1
flood.	1
§	1
3	1
The	1
_Pliocene_	1
period	1
was	1
a	1
more	1
strenuous	1
time,	1
with	1
less	1
genial	1
climatic	1
conditions,	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
intense	1
competition.	1
Old	1
land	1
bridges	1
were	1
broken	1
and	1
new	1
ones	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
geographical	1
distribution	1
underwent	1
great	1
changes.	1
Professor	1
R.	1
S.	1
Lull	1
describes	1
the	1
_Pliocene_	1
as	1
"a	1
period	1
of	1
great	1
unrest."	1
"Many	1
migrations	1
occurred	1
the	1
world	1
over,	1
new	1
competitions	1
arose,	1
and	1
the	1
weaker	1
stocks	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
strenuous	1
life.	1
One	1
momentous	1
event	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
Pliocene,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
transformation	1
of	1
the	1
precursor	1
of	1
humanity	1
into	1
man--the	1
culmination	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
line	1
of	1
evolution."	1
The	1
_Pleistocene_	1
period	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
sifting.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
continued	1
elevation	1
of	1
the	1
continental	1
masses,	1
and	1
Ice	1
Ages	1
set	1
in,	1
relieved	1
by	1
less	1
severe	1
interglacial	1
times	1
when	1
the	1
ice-sheets	1
retreated	1
northwards	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
Many	1
types,	1
like	1
the	1
mammoth,	1
the	1
woolly	1
rhinoceros,	1
the	1
sabre-toothed	1
tiger,	1
the	1
cave-lion,	1
and	1
the	1
cave-bear,	1
became	1
extinct.	1
Others	1
which	1
formerly	1
had	1
a	1
wide	1
range	1
became	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
Far	1
North	1
or	1
were	1
left	1
isolated	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
mountains,	1
like	1
the	1
Snow	1
Mouse,	1
which	1
now	1
occurs	1
on	1
isolated	1
Alpine	1
heights	1
above	1
the	1
snow-line.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
during	1
this	1
period	1
that	1
many	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
Northern	1
Hemisphere	1
learned	1
to	1
evade	1
the	1
winter	1
by	1
the	1
sublime	1
device	1
of	1
migration.	1
Looking	1
backwards	1
we	1
may	1
quote	1
Professor	1
Schuchert	1
again:	1
"The	1
lands	1
in	1
the	1
Cenozoic	1
began	1
to	1
bloom	1
with	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
flowering	1
plants	1
and	1
grand	1
hardwood	1
forests,	1
the	1
atmosphere	1
is	1
scented	1
with	1
sweet	1
odours,	1
a	1
vast	1
crowd	1
of	1
new	1
kinds	1
of	1
insects	1
appear,	1
and	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
the	1
once	1
dominant	1
reptiles	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
and	1
seas	1
are	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
mammals.	1
Out	1
of	1
these	1
struggles	1
there	1
rises	1
a	1
greater	1
intelligence,	1
seen	1
in	1
nearly	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
mammal	1
stocks,	1
but	1
particularly	1
in	1
one,	1
the	1
monkey-ape-man.	1
Brute	1
man	1
appears	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
with	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
glacial	1
climate,	1
a	1
most	1
trying	1
time	1
for	1
all	1
things	1
endowed	1
with	1
life,	1
and	1
finally	1
there	1
results	1
the	1
dominance	1
of	1
reasoning	1
man	1
over	1
all	1
his	1
brute	1
associates."	1
In	1
man	1
and	1
human	1
society	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
evolution	1
has	1
its	1
climax.	1
The	1
Ascent	1
of	1
Man	1
Man	1
stands	1
apart	1
from	1
animals	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
building	1
up	1
general	1
ideas	1
and	1
of	1
using	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
and	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
his	1
conduct.	1
This	1
is	1
essentially	1
wrapped	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
development	1
of	1
language	1
as	1
an	1
instrument	1
of	1
thought.	1
Some	1
animals	1
have	1
words,	1
but	1
man	1
has	1
language	1
(Logos).	1
Some	1
animals	1
show	1
evidence	1
of	1
_perceptual_	1
inference,	1
but	1
man	1
often	1
gets	1
beyond	1
this	1
to	1
_conceptual_	1
inference	1
(Reason).	1
Many	1
animals	1
are	1
affectionate	1
and	1
brave,	1
self-forgetful	1
and	1
industrious,	1
but	1
man	1
"thinks	1
the	1
ought,"	1
definitely	1
guiding	1
his	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
ideals,	1
which	1
in	1
turn	1
are	1
wrapped	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
"a	1
social	1
person."	1
Besides	1
his	1
big	1
brain,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
gorilla,	1
man	1
has	1
various	1
physical	1
peculiarities.	1
He	1
walks	1
erect,	1
he	1
plants	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
flat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
chin	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
heel,	1
a	1
big	1
forehead	1
and	1
a	1
non-protrusive	1
face,	1
a	1
relatively	1
uniform	1
set	1
of	1
teeth	1
without	1
conspicuous	1
canines,	1
and	1
a	1
relatively	1
naked	1
body.	1

brain,	1
could	1
be	1
called	1
momentous.	1
Man's	1
body	1
is	1
a	1
veritable	1
museum	1
of	1
relics	1
(vestigial	1
structures)	1
inherited	1
from	1
pre-human	1
ancestors.	1
In	1
his	1
everyday	1
bodily	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
disturbances,	1
man's	1
pedigree	1
is	1
often	1
revealed.	1
Even	1
his	1
facial	1
expression,	1
as	1
Darwin	1
showed,	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
human.	1
Some	1
fossil	1
remains	1
bring	1
modern	1
man	1
nearer	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
type.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
not	1
to	1
admit	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
closing	1
words	1
of	1
Darwin's	1
_Descent	1
of	1
Man_:	1
"We	1
must,	1
however,	1
acknowledge,	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
man,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
noble	1
qualities,	1
with	1
sympathy	1
which	1
feels	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
debased,	1
with	1
benevolence	1
which	1
extends	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
other	1
men	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
humblest	1
living	1
creature,	1
with	1
his	1
God-like	1
intellect	1
which	1
has	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
movements	1
and	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system--with	1
all	1
these	1
exalted	1
powers--man	1
still	1
bears	1
in	1
his	1
bodily	1
frame	1
the	1
indelible	1
stamp	1
of	1
his	1
lowly	1
origin."	1
THE	1
EVOLVING	1
SYSTEM	1
OF	1
NATURE	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
side	1
of	1
evolution	1
so	1
obvious	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
overlooked,	1
the	1
tendency	1
to	1
link	1
lives	1
together	1
in	1
vital	1
inter-relations.	1
Thus	1
flowers	1
and	1
their	1
insect	1
visitors	1
are	1
often	1
vitally	1
interlinked	1
in	1
mutual	1
dependence.	1
Many	1
birds	1
feed	1
on	1
berries	1
and	1
distribute	1
the	1
seeds.	1
The	1
tiny	1
freshwater	1
snail	1
is	1
the	1
host	1
of	1
the	1
juvenile	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
liver-fluke	1
of	1
the	1
sheep.	1
The	1
mosquito	1
is	1
the	1
vehicle	1
of	1
malaria	1
from	1
man	1
to	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
tse-tse	1
fly	1
spreads	1
sleeping	1
sickness.	1
The	1
freshwater	1
mussel	1
cannot	1
continue	1
its	1
race	1
without	1
the	1
unconscious	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
minnow,	1
and	1
the	1
freshwater	1
fish	1
called	1
the	1
bitterling	1
cannot	1
continue	1
its	1
race	1
without	1
the	1
unconscious	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
mussel.	1
There	1
are	1
numerous	1
mutually	1
beneficial	1
partnerships	1
between	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
creatures,	1
and	1
other	1
inter-relations	1
where	1
the	1
benefit	1
is	1
one-sided,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
insects	1
that	1
make	1
galls	1
on	1
plants.	1
There	1
are	1
also	1
among	1
kindred	1
animals	1
many	1
forms	1
of	1
colonies,	1
communities,	1
and	1
societies.	1
Nutritive	1
chains	1
bind	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
animals	1
together,	1
the	1
cod	1
feeding	1
on	1
the	1
whelk,	1
the	1
whelk	1
on	1
the	1
worm,	1
the	1
worm	1
on	1
the	1
organic	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
successive	1
incarnations	1
and	1
matter	1
is	1
continually	1
passing	1
from	1
one	1
embodiment	1
to	1
another.	1
These	1
instances	1
must	1
suffice	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
central	1
biological	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
web	1
of	1
life,	1
the	1
interlinked	1
System	1
of	1
Animate	1
Nature.	1
Linnæ	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
Systema	1
Naturæmeaning	1
the	1
orderly	1
hierarchy	1
of	1
classes,	1
orders,	1
families,	1
genera,	1
and	1
species;	1
but	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
Darwin	1
in	1
particular	1
some	1
knowledge	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
dynamic	1
Systema	1
Naturæthe	1
network	1
of	1
vital	1
inter-relations.	1
This	1
has	1
become	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
complex	1
as	1
evolution	1
has	1
continued,	1
and	1
man's	1
web	1
is	1
most	1
complex	1
of	1
all.	1
It	1
means	1
making	1
Animate	1
Nature	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
unity;	1
it	1
means	1
an	1
external	1
method	1
of	1
registering	1
steps	1
of	1
progress;	1
it	1
means	1
an	1
evolving	1
set	1
of	1
sieves	1
by	1
which	1
new	1
variations	1
are	1
sifted,	1
and	1
living	1
creatures	1
are	1
kept	1
from	1
slipping	1
down	1
the	1
steep	1
ladder	1
of	1
evolution.	1
Parasitism	1
It	1
sometimes	1
happens	1
that	1
the	1
inter-relation	1
established	1
between	1
one	1
living	1
creature	1
and	1
another	1
works	1
in	1
a	1
retrograde	1
direction.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
many	1
thoroughgoing	1
internal	1
parasites	1
which	1
have	1
sunk	1
into	1
an	1
easygoing	1
kind	1
of	1
life,	1
utterly	1
dependent	1
on	1
their	1
host	1
for	1
food,	1
requiring	1
no	1
exertions,	1
running	1
no	1
risks,	1
and	1
receiving	1
no	1
spur	1
to	1
effort.	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
evolution	1
is	1
not	1
necessarily	1
progressive;	1
everything	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
conditions	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
living	1
creatures	1
have	1
been	1
evolved.	1
When	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
too	1
easygoing,	1
the	1
animal	1
may	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
well	1
adapted	1
to	1
them--as	1
a	1
tapeworm	1
certainly	1
is--but	1
it	1
slips	1
down	1
the	1
rungs	1
of	1
the	1
ladder	1
of	1
evolution.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
minor	1
chapter	1
in	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
evolution--the	1
establishment	1
of	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
parasites,	1
casual	1
and	1
constant,	1
temporary	1
and	1
lifelong,	1
external	1
hangers-on	1
and	1
internal	1
unpaying	1
boarders,	1
those	1
that	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
food-canal	1
and	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
host's	1
food	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
inhabit	1
the	1
blood	1
or	1
the	1
tissues	1
and	1
find	1
their	1
food	1
there.	1
It	1
seems	1
clear	1
that	1
ichneumon	1
grubs	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
which	1
hatch	1
inside	1
a	1
caterpillar	1
and	1
eat	1
it	1
alive	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
parasites	1
as	1
"beasts	1
of	1
prey"	1
working	1
from	1
within.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
sides	1
to	1
this	1
minor	1
chapter:	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
parasite,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
counteractive	1
measures	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
host.	1
Thus	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
a	1
bodyguard	1
of	1
wandering	1
amoeboid	1
cells,	1
which	1
tackle	1
the	1
microbes	1
invading	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
often	1
succeed	1
in	1
overpowering	1
and	1
digesting	1
them.	1
Thus,	1
again,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
protective	1
capacity	1
the	1
blood	1
has	1
of	1
making	1
antagonistic	1
substances	1
or	1
"anti-bodies"	1
which	1
counteract	1
poisons,	1
including	1
the	1
poisons	1
which	1
the	1
intruding	1
parasites	1
often	1
make.	1
THE	1
EVIDENCES	1
OF	1
EVOLUTION--HOW	1
IT	1
CAME	1
ABOUT	1
§	1
1	1
Progress	1
in	1
Evolution	1
There	1
has	1
often	1
been	1
slipping	1
back	1
and	1
degeneracy	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
evolution,	1
but	1
the	1
big	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
progress.	1
For	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
Life	1
has	1
been	1
slowly	1
creeping	1
upwards,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
compare	1
the	1
highest	1
animals--Birds	1
and	1
Mammals--with	1
their	1
predecessors,	1
we	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
controlled,	1
more	1
masters	1
of	1
their	1
fate,	1
with	1
more	1
mentality.	1
Evolution	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
_integrative_;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
it	1
makes	1
against	1
instability	1
and	1
disorder,	1
and	1
towards	1
harmony	1
and	1
progress.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
rise	1
of	1
Birds	1
and	1
Mammals	1
we	1
can	1
discern	1
that	1
the	1
evolutionary	1
process	1
was	1
making	1
towards	1
a	1
fuller	1
embodiment	1
or	1
expression	1
of	1
what	1
Man	1
values	1
most--control,	1
freedom,	1
understanding,	1
and	1
love.	1
The	1
advance	1
of	1
animal	1
life	1
through	1
the	1
ages	1
has	1
been	1
chequered,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
advance	1
towards	1
increasing	1
fullness,	1
freedom,	1
and	1
fitness	1
of	1
life.	1
In	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
this	1
advance--the	1
central	1
fact	1
of	1
Organic	1
Evolution--there	1
is	1
assuredly	1
much	1
for	1
Man's	1
instruction	1
and	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
encouragement.	1
Evidences	1
of	1
Evolution	1
In	1
all	1
this,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said,	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
evolution	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
granted,	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
evidences?	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
frankly	1
answered	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
evolution,	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
cannot	1
be	1
_proved_	1
as	1
one	1
may	1
prove	1
the	1
Law	1
of	1
Gravitation.	1
All	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
key--a	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
things--that	1
fits	1
the	1
facts.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
lock	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
open.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
facts	1
that	1
the	1
evolution	1
theory	1
vividly	1
interprets	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
evidences	1
of	1
its	1
validity,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
lack	1
of	1
them.	1
There	1
is	1
_historical_	1
evidence;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
eloquent	1
than	1
the	1
general	1
fact	1
that	1
fishes	1
emerge	1
before	1
amphibians,	1
and	1
these	1
before	1
reptiles,	1
and	1
these	1
before	1
birds,	1
and	1
so	1
on?	1
There	1
are	1
wonderfully	1
complete	1
fossil	1
series,	1
e.g.	1
among	1
cuttlefishes,	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
almost	1
see	1
evolution	1
in	1
process.	1
The	1
pedigree	1
of	1
horse	1
and	1
elephant	1
and	1
crocodile	1
is	1
in	1
general	1
very	1
convincing,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
cases	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
light.	1
Who	1
can	1
tell,	1
for	1
instance,	1
how	1
Vertebrates	1
arose	1
or	1
from	1
what	1
origin?	1
There	1
is	1
_embryological_	1
evidence,	1
for	1
the	1
individual	1
development	1
often	1
reads	1
like	1
an	1
abbreviated	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
the	1
presumed	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
race.	1
The	1
mammal's	1
visceral	1
clefts	1
are	1
tell-tale	1
evidence	1
of	1
remote	1
aquatic	1
ancestors,	1
breathing	1
by	1
gills.	1
Something	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
historical	1
evolution	1
of	1
antlers	1
in	1
bygone	1
ages;	1
the	1
Red	1
Deer	1
of	1
to-day	1
recapitulates	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
general	1
outlines	1
of	1
the	1
history.	1
The	1
individual	1
development	1
of	1
an	1
asymmetrical	1
flat-fish,	1
like	1
a	1
plaice	1
or	1
sole,	1
which	1
rests	1
and	1
swims	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
tells	1
us	1
plainly	1
that	1
its	1
ancestors	1
were	1
symmetrical	1
fishes.	1
There	1
is	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
_physiological_	1
evidence,	1
for	1
many	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
are	1
variable	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
and	1
evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
us	1
to-day.	1
This	1
is	1
familiarly	1
seen	1
among	1
domesticated	1
animals	1
and	1
cultivated	1
plants,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
abundant	1
flux	1
in	1
Wild	1
Nature.	1
It	1
need	1
hardly	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
some	1
organisms	1
are	1
very	1
conservative,	1
and	1
that	1
change	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
when	1
a	1
position	1
of	1
stable	1
equilibrium	1
has	1
been	1
secured.	1
There	1
is	1
also	1
_anatomical_	1
evidence	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
convincing	1
quality.	1
In	1
the	1
fore-limbs	1
of	1
backboned	1
animals,	1
say,	1
the	1
paddle	1
of	1
a	1
turtle,	1
the	1
wing	1
of	1
a	1
bird,	1
the	1
flipper	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
the	1
fore-leg	1
of	1
a	1
horse,	1
and	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
a	1
man;	1
the	1
same	1
essential	1
bones	1
and	1
muscles	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
such	1
diverse	1
results!	1
What	1
could	1
it	1
mean	1
save	1
blood	1
relationship?	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
sets	1
of	1
teeth	1
in	1
whalebone	1
whales,	1
which	1
never	1
even	1
cut	1
the	1
gum,	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
alternative	1
but	1
to	1
regard	1
them	1
as	1
relics	1
of	1
useful	1
teeth	1
which	1
ancestral	1
forms	1
possessed?	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
evolution	1
theory	1
is	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
works.	1
§	1
2	1
Factors	1
in	1
Evolution	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
"So	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
_fact_	1
of	1
evolution,	1
but	1
what	1
of	1
the	1
_factors_?"	1
the	1
answer	1
is	1
not	1
easy.	1
For	1
not	1
only	1
is	1
the	1
problem	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
scientific	1
problems,	1
but	1
the	1
inquiry	1
is	1
still	1
very	1
young.	1
The	1
scientific	1
study	1
of	1
evolution	1
practically	1
dates	1
from	1
the	1
publication	1
of	1
_The	1
Origin	1
of	1
Species_	1
in	1
1859.	1
Heritable	1
novelties	1
or	1
variations	1
often	1
crop	1
up	1
in	1
living	1
creatures,	1
and	1
these	1
form	1
the	1
raw	1
material	1
of	1
evolution.	1
These	1
variations	1
are	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
expression	1
of	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
germ-cells	1
that	1
develop	1
into	1
organisms.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
germ-cells?	1
Perhaps	1
because	1
the	1
living	1
material	1
is	1
very	1
complex	1
and	1
inherently	1
liable	1
to	1
change;	1
perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
vehicle	1
of	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
hereditary	1
items	1
among	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
reshufflings	1
or	1
rearrangements;	1
perhaps	1
because	1
the	1
germ-cells	1
have	1
very	1
changeful	1
surroundings	1
(the	1
blood,	1
the	1
body-cavity	1
fluid,	1
the	1
sea-water);	1
perhaps	1
because	1
deeply	1
saturating	1
outside	1
influences,	1
such	1
as	1
change	1
of	1
climate	1
and	1
habitat,	1
penetrate	1
through	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
its	1
germ-cells	1
and	1
provoke	1
them	1
to	1
vary.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
patient	1
with	1
the	1
wearisome	1
reiteration	1
of	1
"perhaps."	1
Moreover,	1
every	1
many-celled	1
organism	1
reproduced	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way,	1
arises	1
from	1
an	1
egg-cell	1
fertilised	1
by	1
a	1
sperm-cell,	1
and	1
the	1
changes	1
involved	1
in	1
and	1
preparatory	1
to	1
this	1
fertilisation	1
may	1
make	1
new	1
permutations	1
and	1
combinations	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
items	1
and	1
hereditary	1
qualities	1
not	1
only	1
possible	1
but	1
necessary.	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
like	1
shuffling	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
cards,	1
but	1
the	1
cards	1
are	1
living.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
changes	1
wrought	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
during	1
its	1
lifetime	1
by	1
peculiarities	1
in	1
nurture,	1
habits,	1
and	1
surroundings,	1
these	1
dents	1
or	1
modifications	1
are	1
often	1
very	1
important	1
for	1
the	1
individual,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
directly	1
important	1
for	1
the	1
race,	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
certain	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
transmissible.	1
Given	1
a	1
crop	1
of	1
variations	1
or	1
new	1
departures	1
or	1
mutations,	1
whatever	1
the	1
inborn	1
novelties	1
may	1
be	1
called,	1
we	1
have	1
then	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
these	1
are	1
sifted.	1
The	1
sifting,	1
which	1
means	1
the	1
elimination	1
of	1
the	1
relatively	1
less	1
fit	1
variations	1
and	1
the	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
relatively	1
more	1
fit,	1
effected	1
in	1
many	1
different	1
ways	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence.	1
The	1
organism	1
plays	1
its	1
new	1
card	1
in	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
consequences	1
may	1
determine	1
survival.	1
The	1
relatively	1
less	1
fit	1
to	1
given	1
conditions	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
eliminated,	1
while	1
the	1
relatively	1
more	1
fit	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
survive.	1
If	1
the	1
variations	1
are	1
hereditary	1
and	1
reappear,	1
perhaps	1
increased	1
in	1
amount,	1
generation	1
after	1
generation,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
sifting	1
continue	1
consistently,	1
the	1
result	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
species.	1
The	1
sifting	1
process	1
may	1
be	1
helped	1
by	1
various	1
forms	1
of	1
"isolation"	1
which	1
lessen	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
free	1
intercrossing	1
between	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
species,	1
e.g.	1
by	1
geographical	1
barriers.	1
Interbreeding	1
of	1
similar	1
forms	1
tends	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
stable	1
stock;	1
out-breeding	1
among	1
dissimilars	1
tends	1
to	1
promote	1
variability.	1
But	1
for	1
an	1
outline	1
like	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
suggest	1
the	1
general	1
method	1
of	1
organic	1
evolution:	1
Throughout	1
the	1
ages	1
organisms	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
tentatives--new	1
departures	1
of	1
varying	1
magnitude--and	1
these	1
tentatives	1
have	1
been	1
tested.	1
The	1
method	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
testing	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
holding	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1

ADAPTATIONS	1
TO	1
ENVIRONMENT	1
We	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
chapter	1
how	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
evolution	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
mastery	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
haunts	1
of	1
life.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
these	1
haunts	1
or	1
homes	1
of	1
animals	1
in	1
some	1
detail,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
peculiar	1
circumstances	1
of	1
each,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
ages	1
of	1
struggle	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
self-preserving	1
and	1
race-continuing	1
adaptations	1
or	1
fitnesses	1
have	1
been	1
wrought	1
out	1
and	1
firmly	1
established.	1
Living	1
creatures	1
have	1
spread	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
waters	1
under	1
the	1
earth;	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
conquered	1
the	1
underground	1
world	1
and	1
others	1
the	1
air.	1
It	1
is	1
possible,	1
however,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
indicated,	1
to	1
distinguish	1
six	1
great	1
haunts	1
of	1
life,	1
each	1
tenanted	1
by	1
a	1
distinctive	1
fauna,	1
namely,	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
the	1
freshwaters,	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
air.	1
In	1
the	1
deep	1
sea	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
plants	1
at	1
all;	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
only	1
plants	1
are	1
floating	1
bacteria,	1
though	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
tree	1
is	1
very	1
aerial,	1
and	1
the	1
orchid	1
perched	1
on	1
its	1
branches	1
still	1
more	1
so;	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
four	1
haunts	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
flora	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
fauna--the	1
two	1
working	1
into	1
one	1
another's	1
hands	1
in	1
interesting	1
and	1
often	1
subtle	1
inter-relations--the	1
subject	1
of	1
a	1
separate	1
study.	1
I.	1
THE	1
SHORE	1
OF	1
THE	1
SEA	1
The	1
Seaweed	1
Area	1
By	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
the	1
zoologist	1
means	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
narrow	1
zone	1
between	1
tide-marks;	1
he	1
means	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
relatively	1
shallow,	1
well-illumined,	1
seaweed-growing	1
shelf	1
around	1
the	1
continents	1
and	1
continental	1
islands.	1
Technically,	1
this	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
littoral	1
area,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
divisible	1
into	1
zones,	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
characteristic	1
population.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
noted	1
that	1
the	1
green	1
seaweeds	1
are	1
highest	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
shore;	1
the	1
brown	1
ones	1
come	1
next;	1
the	1
beautiful	1
red	1
ones	1
are	1
lowest.	1
All	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
got	1
green	1
chlorophyll,	1
which	1
enables	1
them	1
to	1
utilise	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays	1
in	1
photosynthesis	1
(i.e.	1
building	1
up	1
carbon	1
compounds	1
from	1
air,	1
water,	1
and	1
salts),	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
brown	1
and	1
red	1
seaweeds	1
the	1
green	1
pigment	1
is	1
masked	1
by	1
others.	1
It	1
is	1
maintained	1
by	1
some	1
botanists	1
that	1
these	1
other	1
pigments	1
enable	1
their	1
possessors	1
to	1
make	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
scantier	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
deeper	1
waters.	1
However	1
this	1
may	1
be,	1
we	1
must	1
always	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
shore-haunt	1
as	1
the	1
seaweed-growing	1
area.	1
Directly	1
and	1
indirectly	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
animals	1
is	1
closely	1
wrapped	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
seaweeds,	1
which	1
afford	1
food	1
and	1
foothold,	1
and	1
temper	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
waves.	1
The	1
minute	1
fragments	1
broken	1
off	1
from	1
seaweeds	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
sea-grass	1
(a	1
flowering	1
plant	1
called	1
Zostera)	1
form	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
nutritive	1
sea-dust	1
which	1
is	1
swept	1
slowly	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
from	1
the	1
shore,	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
very	1
useful	1
deposit	1
in	1
the	1
quietness	1
of	1
deepish	1
water.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
stomachs	1
of	1
marine	1
animals	1
living	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
offshore.	1
Conditions	1
of	1
Shore	1
Life	1
The	1
littoral	1
area	1
as	1
defined	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
large	1
haunt	1
of	1
life;	1
it	1
occupies	1
only	1
about	1
9	1
million	1
square	1
miles,	1
a	1
small	1
fraction	1
of	1
the	1
197,000,000	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth's	1
surface.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
haunt,	1
some	1
150,000	1
miles,	1
winding	1
in	1
and	1
out	1
by	1
bay	1
and	1
fiord,	1
estuary	1
and	1
creek.	1
Where	1
deep	1
water	1
comes	1
close	1
to	1
cliffs	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
shore	1
at	1
all;	1
in	1
other	1
places	1
the	1
relatively	1
shallow	1
water,	1
with	1
seaweeds	1
growing	1
over	1
the	1
bottom,	1
may	1
extend	1
outwards	1
for	1
miles.	1
The	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
varies	1
greatly	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
rocks,	1
according	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
streams	1
bring	1
down	1
from	1
inland,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
jetsam	1
that	1
is	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
tides.	1
The	1
shore	1
is	1
a	1
changeful	1
place;	1
there	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
reaches,	1
a	1
striking	1
difference	1
between	1
"tide	1
in"	1
and	1
"tide	1
out";	1
there	1
are	1
vicissitudes	1
due	1
to	1
storms,	1
to	1
freshwater	1
floods,	1
to	1
wind-blown	1
sand,	1
and	1
to	1
slow	1
changes	1
of	1
level,	1
up	1
and	1
down.	1
The	1
shore	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
crowded	1
haunt,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
comparatively	1
narrow,	1
and	1
every	1
niche	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
may	1
be	1
precious.	1

Keen	1
Struggle	1
for	1
Existence	1
It	1
follows	1
that	1
the	1
shore	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
a	1
keen	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence--which	1
includes	1
all	1
the	1
answers-back	1
that	1
living	1
creatures	1
make	1
to	1
environing	1
difficulties	1
and	1
limitations.	1
There	1
is	1
struggle	1
for	1
food,	1
accentuated	1
by	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
small	1
items	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
swept	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
outgoing	1
tide	1
or	1
to	1
sink	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
to	1
deep	1
water.	1
Apart	1
from	1
direct	1
competition,	1
e.g.	1
between	1
hungry	1
hermit-crabs,	1
it	1
often	1
involves	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
meal.	1
This	1
is	1
true	1
even	1
of	1
apparently	1
sluggish	1
creatures.	1
Thus	1
the	1
Crumb-of-Bread	1
Sponge,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
seashore	1
sponge,	1
has	1
to	1
lash	1
large	1
quantities	1
of	1
water	1
through	1
the	1
intricate	1
canal	1
system	1
of	1
its	1
body	1
before	1
it	1
can	1
get	1
a	1
sufficient	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
microscopic	1
organisms	1
and	1
organic	1
particles	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
feeds.	1
An	1
index	1
of	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
food	1
is	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
nutritive	1
chains	1
which	1
bind	1
animals	1
together.	1
The	1
shore	1
is	1
almost	1
noisy	1
with	1
the	1
conjugation	1
of	1
the	1
verb	1
to	1
eat	1
in	1
its	1
many	1
tenses.	1
One	1
pound	1
of	1
rock-cod	1
requires	1
for	1
its	1
formation	1
ten	1
pounds	1
of	1
whelk;	1
one	1
pound	1
of	1
whelk	1
requires	1
ten	1
pounds	1
of	1
sea-worms;	1
and	1
one	1
pound	1
of	1
worms	1
requires	1
ten	1
pounds	1
of	1
sea-dust.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
circulation	1
of	1
matter,	1
ever	1
passing	1
from	1
one	1
embodiment	1
or	1
incarnation	1
to	1
another.	1
Besides	1
struggle	1
for	1
food	1
there	1
is	1
struggle	1
for	1
foothold	1
and	1
for	1
fresh	1
air,	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
scouring	1
tide	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
pounding	1
breakers.	1
The	1
risk	1
of	1
dislodgment	1
is	1
often	1
great	1
and	1
the	1
fracture	1
of	1
limbs	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
accident.	1
Of	1
kinds	1
of	1
armour--the	1
sea-urchin's	1
hedgehog-like	1
test,	1
the	1
crab's	1
shard,	1
the	1
limpet's	1
shell--there	1
is	1
great	1
variety,	1
surpassed	1
only	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
weapons--the	1
sea-anemone's	1
stinging-cells,	1
the	1
sea-urchin's	1
snapping-blades,	1
the	1
hermit-crab's	1
forceps,	1
the	1
grappling	1
tentacles	1
and	1
parrot's-beak	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
octopus.	1
Shifts	1
for	1
a	1
Living	1
We	1
get	1
another	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
the	1
seashore	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
in	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
"shifts	1
for	1
a	1
living,"	1
adaptations	1
of	1
structure	1
or	1
of	1
behaviour	1
which	1
meet	1
frequently	1
recurrent	1
vicissitudes.	1
The	1
starfish	1
is	1
often	1
in	1
the	1
dilemma	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
limb	1
or	1
its	1
life;	1
by	1
a	1
reflex	1
action	1
it	1
jettisons	1
the	1
captured	1
arm	1
and	1
escapes.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
lost	1
is	1
gradually	1
regrown.	1
The	1
crab	1
gets	1
its	1
leg	1
broken	1
past	1
all	1
mending;	1
it	1
casts	1
off	1
the	1
leg	1
across	1
a	1
weak	1
breakage	1
plane	1
near	1
the	1
base,	1
and	1
within	1
a	1
preformed	1
bandage	1
which	1
prevents	1
bleeding	1
a	1
new	1
leg	1
is	1
formed	1
in	1
miniature.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
adaptive	1
device--more	1
reflex	1
than	1
reflective--which	1
is	1
called	1
self-mutilation	1
or	1
autotomy.	1
In	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
discussion	1
of	1
camouflaging	1
and	1
protective	1
resemblance;	1
how	1
abundantly	1
these	1
are	1
illustrated	1
on	1
the	1
shore!	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
"shifts	1
for	1
a	1
living."	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
sand-hoppers	1
and	1
their	1
relatives	1
illustrate	1
the	1
puzzling	1
phenomenon	1
of	1
"feigning	1
death,"	1
becoming	1
suddenly	1
so	1
motionless	1
that	1
they	1
escape	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
their	1
enemies.	1
Cuttlefishes,	1
by	1
discharging	1
sepia	1
from	1
their	1
ink-bags,	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
throw	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
their	1
enemies.	1
Some	1
undisguised	1
shore-animals,	1
e.g.	1
crabs,	1
are	1
adepts	1
in	1
a	1
hide-and-seek	1
game;	1
some	1
fishes,	1
like	1
the	1
butterfish	1
or	1
gunnel,	1
escape	1
between	1
stones	1
where	1
there	1
seemed	1
no	1
opening	1
and	1
are	1
almost	1
uncatchable	1
in	1
their	1
slipperiness.	1
Subtlest	1
of	1
all,	1
perhaps,	1
is	1
the	1
habit	1
some	1
hermit-crabs	1
have	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
mutually	1
beneficial	1
partnership	1
(commensalism)	1
with	1
sea-anemones,	1
which	1
mask	1
their	1
bearers	1
and	1
also	1
serve	1
as	1
mounted	1
batteries,	1
getting	1
transport	1
as	1
their	1
reward	1
and	1
likewise	1
crumbs	1
from	1
the	1
frequently	1
spread	1
table.	1
But	1
enough	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
shore-haunt	1
exhibits	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
variety	1
of	1
shifts	1
for	1
a	1
living.	1
Parental	1
Care	1
on	1
the	1
Shore	1
According	1
to	1
Darwin,	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence,	1
as	1
a	1
big	1
fact	1
in	1
the	1
economy	1
of	1
Animate	1
Nature,	1
includes	1
not	1
only	1
competition	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
endeavours	1
which	1
secure	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
offspring,	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
send-off	1
in	1
life.	1
So	1
it	1
is	1
without	1
a	1
jolt	1
that	1
we	1
pass	1
from	1
struggle	1
for	1
food	1
and	1
foothold	1
to	1
parental	1
care.	1
The	1
marine	1
leech	1
called	1
Pontobdella,	1
an	1
interesting	1
greenish	1
warty	1
creature	1
fond	1
of	1
fixing	1
itself	1
to	1
skate,	1
places	1
its	1
egg-cocoons	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
shell	1
of	1
a	1
bivalve	1
mollusc,	1
and	1
guards	1
them	1
for	1
weeks,	1
removing	1
any	1
mud	1
that	1
might	1
injure	1
their	1
development.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
British	1
starfish	1
with	1
its	1
fully-formed	1
young	1
ones	1
creeping	1
about	1
on	1
its	1
body,	1
though	1
the	1
usual	1
mode	1
of	1
development	1
for	1
shore	1
starfishes	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
pass	1
through	1
a	1
free-swimming	1
larval	1
period	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
water.	1
The	1
father	1
sea-spider	1
carries	1
about	1
the	1
eggs	1
attached	1
to	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
limbs;	1
the	1
father	1
sea-horse	1
puts	1
his	1
mate's	1
eggs	1
into	1
his	1
breast	1
pocket	1
and	1
carries	1
them	1
there	1
in	1
safety	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
hatched;	1
the	1
father	1
stickleback	1
of	1
the	1
shore-pools	1
makes	1
a	1
seaweed	1
nest	1
and	1
guards	1
the	1
eggs	1
which	1
his	1
wives	1
are	1
induced	1
to	1
lay	1
there;	1
the	1
father	1
lumpsucker	1
mounts	1
guard	1
over	1
the	1
bunch	1
of	1
pinkish	1
eggs	1
which	1
his	1
mate	1
has	1
laid	1
in	1
a	1
nook	1
of	1
a	1
rocky	1
shore-pool,	1
and	1
drives	1
off	1
intruders	1
with	1
zest.	1
He	1
also	1
aerates	1
the	1
developing	1
eggs	1
by	1
frequent	1
paddling	1
with	1
his	1
pectoral	1
fins	1
and	1
tail,	1
as	1
the	1
Scots	1
name	1
Cock-paidle	1
probably	1
suggests.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
that	1
the	1
salient	1
examples	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
shore-haunt	1
are	1
mostly	1
on	1
the	1
male	1
parent's	1
side.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
maternal	1
virtue	1
as	1
well.	1

The	1
fauna	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
is	1
remarkably	1
_representative_--from	1
unicellular	1
Protozoa	1
to	1
birds	1
like	1
the	1
oyster-catcher	1
and	1
mammals	1
like	1
the	1
seals.	1
Almost	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
groups	1
of	1
animals	1
have	1
apparently	1
served	1
an	1
apprenticeship	1
in	1
the	1
shore-haunt,	1
and	1
since	1
lessons	1
learned	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
sink	1
in	1
and	1
become	1
organically	1
enregistered,	1
it	1
is	1
justifiable	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
school	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
gained	1
racial	1
qualities	1
of	1
endurance,	1
patience,	1
and	1
alertness.	1
II.	1
THE	1
OPEN	1
SEA	1
In	1
great	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
narrow,	1
crowded,	1
difficult	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
shore-haunt	1
(littoral	1
area)	1
are	1
the	1
spacious,	1
bountiful,	1
and	1
relatively	1
easygoing	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
(pelagic	1
area),	1
which	1
means	1
the	1
well-lighted	1
surface	1
waters	1
quite	1
away	1
from	1
land.	1
Many	1
small	1
organisms	1
have	1
their	1
maximum	1
abundance	1
at	1
about	1
fifty	1
fathoms,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
word	1
"surface"	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
generously.	1
The	1
light	1
becomes	1
very	1
dim	1
at	1
250	1
fathoms,	1
and	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
as	1
a	1
zoological	1
haunt,	1
stops	1
with	1
the	1
light.	1
It	1
is	1
hardly	1
necessary	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
pelagic	1
plants	1
are	1
more	1
abundant	1
near	1
the	1
surface,	1
and	1
that	1
below	1
a	1
certain	1
depth	1
the	1
population	1
consists	1
almost	1
exclusively	1
of	1
animals.	1
Not	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
animals	1
sink	1
and	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
periodically;	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
that	1
come	1
near	1
the	1
surface	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
come	1
near	1
the	1
surface	1
by	1
night.	1
Of	1
great	1
interest	1
is	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
the	1
extremely	1
delicate	1
Ctenophores	1
or	1
"sea-gooseberries,"	1
which	1
the	1
splash	1
of	1
a	1
wave	1
would	1
tear	1
into	1
shreds.	1
Whenever	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
storm	1
they	1
sink	1
beyond	1
its	1
reach,	1
and	1
the	1
ocean's	1
surface	1
must	1
have	1
remained	1
flat	1
as	1
a	1
mirror	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
before	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
lured	1
upwards	1
from	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
their	1
deep	1
retreat.	1
The	1
Floating	1
Sea-meadows	1
To	1
understand	1
the	1
vital	1
economy	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
we	1
must	1
recognise	1
the	1
incalculable	1
abundance	1
of	1
minute	1
unicellular	1
plants,	1
for	1
they	1
form	1
the	1
fundamental	1
food-supply.	1
Along	1
with	1
these	1
must	1
also	1
be	1
included	1
numerous	1
microscopic	1
animals	1
which	1
have	1
got	1
possession	1
of	1
chlorophyll,	1
or	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
internal	1
partnership	1
with	1
unicellular	1
Algæsymbiosis).	1
These	1
green	1
or	1
greenish	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
are	1
the	1
_producers_,	1
using	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
sunlight	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
in	1
building	1
up	1
carbon	1
compounds	1
out	1
of	1
air,	1
water,	1
and	1
salts.	1
The	1
animals	1
which	1
feed	1
on	1
the	1
producers,	1
or	1
on	1
other	1
animals,	1
are	1
the	1
_consumers_.	1
Between	1
the	1
two	1
come	1
those	1
open-sea	1
bacteria	1
that	1
convert	1
nitrogenous	1
material,	1
e.g.	1
from	1
dead	1
plants	1
or	1
animals	1
that	1
other	1
bacteria	1
have	1
rotted,	1
into	1
forms,	1
e.g.	1
nitrates,	1
which	1
plants	1
can	1
re-utilise.	1
The	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
_middlemen_	1
is	1
great	1
in	1
keeping	1
"the	1
circulation	1
of	1
matter"	1
agoing.	1

The	1
"floating	1
sea-meadows,"	1
as	1
Sir	1
John	1
Murray	1
called	1
them,	1
are	1
always	1
receiving	1
contributions	1
from	1
inshore	1
waters,	1
where	1
the	1
conditions	1
are	1
favourable	1
for	1
the	1
prolific	1
multiplication	1
of	1
unicellular	1
Algæand	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
non-living	1
sea-dust	1
always	1
being	1
swept	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
seaweed	1

area.	1
Swimmers	1
and	1
Drifters	1
The	1
animals	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea	1
are	1
conveniently	1
divided	1
into	1
the	1
active	1
swimmers	1
(Nekton)	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
passive	1
drifters	1
(Plankton).	1
The	1
swimmers	1
include	1
whales	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
such	1
birds	1
as	1
the	1
storm	1
petrel,	1
the	1
fish-eating	1
turtles	1
and	1
sea-snakes,	1
such	1
fishes	1
as	1
mackerel	1
and	1
herring,	1
the	1
winged	1
snails	1
or	1
sea-butterflies	1
on	1
which	1
whalebone	1
whales	1
largely	1
feed,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
active	1
cuttles	1
or	1
squids,	1
various	1
open-sea	1
prawns	1
and	1
their	1
relatives,	1
some	1
worms	1
like	1
the	1
transparent	1
arrow-worm,	1
and	1
such	1
active	1
Protozoa	1
as	1
Noctiluca,	1
whose	1
luminescence	1
makes	1
the	1
waves	1
sparkle	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
summer	1
darkness.	1
Very	1
striking	1
as	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
insurgence	1
of	1
life	1
are	1
the	1
sea-skimmers	1
(Halobatidæ	1
wingless	1
insects	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
water-measurers	1
in	1
the	1
ditch.	1
They	1
are	1
found	1
hundreds	1
of	1
miles	1
from	1
land,	1
skimming	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
and	1
diving	1
in	1
stormy	1
weather.	1
They	1
feed	1
on	1
floating	1
dead	1
animals.	1
The	1
drifters	1
or	1
easygoing	1
swimmers--for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hard	1
and	1
fast	1
line--are	1
represented,	1
for	1
instance,	1
by	1
the	1
flinty-shelled	1
Radiolarians	1
and	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
chalk-forming	1
animals	1
(Globigerinid	1
Foraminifera);	1
by	1
jellyfishes,	1
swimming-bells,	1
and	1
Portuguese	1
men-of-war;	1
by	1
the	1
comb-bearers	1
or	1
Ctenophores;	1
by	1
legions	1
of	1
minute	1
Crustaceans;	1
by	1
strange	1
animals	1
called	1
Salps,	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
sedentary	1
sea-squirts;	1
and	1
by	1
some	1
sluggish	1
fishes	1
like	1
globe-fishes,	1
which	1
often	1
float	1
idly	1
on	1
the	1
surface.	1
Open-sea	1
animals	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
delicately	1
built,	1
with	1
a	1
specific	1
gravity	1
near	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
sea-water,	1
with	1
adaptations,	1
such	1
as	1
projecting	1
filaments,	1
which	1
help	1
flotation,	1
and	1
with	1
capacities	1
of	1
rising	1
and	1
sinking	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
surrounding	1
conditions.	1
Many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
luminescent,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
very	1
inconspicuous	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
owing	1
to	1
their	1
transparency	1
or	1
their	1
bluish	1
colour.	1
In	1
both	1
cases	1
the	1
significance	1
is	1
obscure.	1
Hunger	1
and	1
Love	1
Hunger	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
evidence	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
especially	1
in	1
areas	1
where	1
the	1
Plankton	1
is	1
poor.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
great	1
diversity	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
for	1
instance,	1
having	1
a	1
scanty	1
Plankton	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
North	1
Sea.	1
In	1
the	1
South	1
Pacific,	1
west	1
of	1
Patagonia,	1
there	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
immense	1
"sea	1
desert"	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
Plankton,	1
and	1
therefore	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
fishes.	1
The	1
success	1
of	1
fisheries	1
in	1
the	1
North,	1
e.g.	1
on	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
cod-banks,	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
richness	1
of	1
the	1
floating	1
sea-meadows	1
and	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
constituents	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
Plankton.	1
Hunger	1
is	1
plain	1
enough	1
when	1
the	1
Baleen	1
Whale	1
rushes	1
through	1
the	1
water	1
with	1
open	1
jaws,	1
engulfing	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
cavern	1
of	1
its	1
mouth,	1
where	1
the	1
pendent	1
whalebone	1
plates	1
form	1
a	1
huge	1
sieve,	1
incalculable	1
millions	1
of	1
small	1
fry.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
love	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
hunger	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea.	1
The	1
maternal	1
care	1
exhibited	1
by	1
the	1
whale	1
reaches	1
a	1
very	1
high	1
level,	1
and	1
the	1
delicate	1
shell	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
Paper	1
Nautilus	1
or	1
Argonaut,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
eggs	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
are	1
sheltered,	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
described	1
as	1
"the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
cradle	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
Besides	1
the	1
permanent	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
larval	1
stages	1
of	1
many	1
shore-animals	1
which	1
are	1
there	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
For	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
interesting	1
give	1
and	1
take	1
between	1
the	1
shore-haunt	1
and	1
the	1
open	1
sea.	1
From	1
the	1
shore	1
come	1
nutritive	1
contributions	1
and	1
minute	1
organisms	1
which	1
multiply	1
quickly	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
waters.	1
But	1
not	1
less	1
important	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
open	1
waters	1
afford	1
a	1
safe	1
cradle	1
or	1
nursery	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
delicate	1
larva,	1
e.g.	1
of	1
crab	1
and	1
starfish,	1
acorn-shell	1
and	1
sea-urchin,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
survive	1
for	1
a	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
rough-and-tumble	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
shore	1
and	1
the	1
shallow	1
water.	1
After	1
undergoing	1
radical	1
changes	1
and	1
gaining	1
strength,	1
the	1
young	1
creatures	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
in	1
various	1
ways.	1
III.	1
THE	1
DEEP	1
SEA	1
Very	1
different	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
haunts	1
are	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
including	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
abysses	1
and	1
the	1
zones	1
of	1
water	1
near	1
the	1
bottom.	1
This	1
haunt,	1
forever	1
unseen,	1
occupies	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
thickly	1
peopled.	1
It	1
came	1
into	1
emphatic	1
notice	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
mending	1
of	1
telegraph	1
cables,	1
but	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
the	1
_Challenger_	1
expedition	1
(1873-6)	1
gave	1
the	1
first	1
impressive	1
picture	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
practically	1
a	1
new	1
world.	1
Physical	1
Conditions	1
The	1
average	1
depth	1
of	1
the	1
ocean	1
is	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
miles;	1
therefore,	1
since	1
many	1
parts	1
are	1
relatively	1
shallow,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
enormous	1
depths.	1
A	1
few	1
of	1
these,	1
technically	1
called	1
"deeps,"	1
are	1
about	1
six	1
miles	1
deep,	1
in	1
which	1
Mount	1
Everest	1
would	1
be	1
engulfed.	1
There	1
is	1
enormous	1
pressure	1
in	1
such	1
depths;	1
even	1
at	1
2,500	1
fathoms	1
it	1
is	1
two	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
tons	1
on	1
the	1
square	1
inch.	1
The	1
temperature	1
is	1
on	1
and	1
off	1
the	1
freezing-point	1
of	1
fresh	1
water	1
(28°-34°	1
Fahr.),	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
continual	1
sinking	1
down	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
Poles,	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
South.	1
Apart	1
from	1
the	1
fitful	1
gleams	1
of	1
luminescent	1
animals,	1
there	1
is	1
utter	1
darkness	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
waters.	1
The	1
rays	1
of	1
sunlight	1
are	1
practically	1
extinguished	1
at	1
250	1
fathoms,	1
though	1
very	1
sensitive	1
bromogelatine	1
plates	1
exposed	1
at	1
500	1
fathoms	1
have	1
shown	1
faint	1
indications	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
depth.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
absolute	1
calm	1
and	1
silence,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
scenery	1
on	1
the	1
floor.	1
A	1
deep,	1
cold,	1
dark,	1
silent,	1
monotonous	1
world!	1
Biological	1
Conditions	1
While	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
abysses	1
are	1
more	1
thickly	1
peopled	1
than	1
others,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
depth	1
limit	1
to	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
life.	1
Wherever	1
the	1
long	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
dredge	1
has	1
reached,	1
animals	1
have	1
been	1
found,	1
e.g.	1
Protozoa,	1
sponges,	1
corals,	1
worms,	1
starfishes,	1
sea-urchins,	1
sea-lilies,	1
crustaceans,	1
lamp-shells,	1
molluscs,	1
ascidians,	1
and	1
fishes--a	1
very	1
representative	1
fauna.	1
In	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
light	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
chlorophyll-possessing	1
plants,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
animals	1
cannot	1
all	1
be	1
eating	1
one	1
another	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
extraneous	1
source	1
of	1
food-supply.	1
This	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
sinking	1
down	1
of	1
minute	1
organisms	1
which	1
are	1
killed	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
by	1
changes	1
of	1
temperature	1
and	1
other	1
causes.	1
What	1
is	1
left	1
of	1
them,	1
before	1
or	1
after	1
being	1
swallowed,	1
and	1
of	1
sea-dust	1
and	1
mineral	1
particles	1
of	1
various	1
kinds	1
forms	1
the	1
diversified	1
"ooze"	1
of	1
the	1
sea-floor,	1
a	1
soft	1
muddy	1
precipitate,	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
places	1
the	1
consistence	1
of	1
butter	1
in	1
summer	1
weather.	1
There	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
bacteria	1
in	1
the	1
abysses,	1
so	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
rotting.	1
Everything	1
that	1
sinks	1
down,	1
even	1
the	1
huge	1
carcase	1
of	1
a	1
whale,	1
must	1
be	1
nibbled	1
away	1
by	1
hungry	1
animals	1
and	1
digested,	1
or	1
else,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
most	1
bones,	1
slowly	1
dissolved	1
away.	1
Of	1
the	1
whale	1
there	1
are	1
left	1
only	1
the	1
ear-bones,	1
of	1
the	1
shark	1
his	1
teeth.	1
Adaptations	1
to	1
Deep-sea	1
Life	1
In	1
adaptation	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
pressure	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
deep-sea	1
animals	1
are	1
usually	1
very	1
permeable,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
water	1
gets	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
them,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Venus'	1
Flower	1
Basket,	1
a	1
flinty	1
sponge	1
which	1
a	1
child's	1
finger	1
would	1
shiver.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
pressure	1
inside	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
that	1
outside	1
nothing	1
happens.	1
In	1
adaptation	1
to	1
the	1
treacherous	1
ooze,	1
so	1
apt	1
to	1
smother,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
active	1
deep-sea	1
animals	1
have	1
very	1
long,	1
stilt-like	1
legs,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
sedentary	1
types	1
are	1
lifted	1
into	1
safety	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
long	1
stalks	1
which	1
have	1
their	1
bases	1
embedded	1
in	1
the	1
mud.	1
In	1
adaptation	1
to	1
the	1
darkness,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
luminescence	1
that	1
eyes	1
could	1
use,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
development	1
of	1
tactility.	1
The	1
interesting	1
problem	1
of	1
luminescence	1
will	1
be	1
discussed	1
elsewhere.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
deep-sea	1
fauna,	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
arisen	1
by	1
many	1
contributions	1
from	1
the	1
various	1
shore-haunts.	1
Following	1
the	1
down-drifting	1
food,	1
many	1
shore-animals	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
many	1
generations	1
reached	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
eternal	1
night	1
and	1
winter,	1
and	1
become	1
adapted	1
to	1
its	1
strange	1
conditions.	1
For	1
the	1
animals	1
of	1
the	1
deep-sea	1
are	1
as	1
fit,	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
vigorous	1
as	1
those	1
elsewhere.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
slums	1
in	1
Nature.	1

THE	1
FRESH	1
WATERS	1
Of	1
the	1
whole	1
earth's	1
surface	1
the	1
freshwaters	1
form	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
fraction,	1
about	1
a	1
hundredth,	1
but	1
they	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
their	1
smallness	1
by	1
their	1
variety.	1
We	1
think	1
of	1
deep	1
lake	1
and	1
shallow	1
pond,	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
purling	1
brook,	1
of	1
lagoon	1
and	1
swamp,	1
and	1
more	1
besides.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
in	1
the	1
animal	1
population	1
of	1
widely	1
separated	1
freshwater	1
basins:	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
partly	1
because	1
birds	1
carry	1
many	1
small	1
creatures	1
on	1
their	1
muddy	1
feet	1
from	1
one	1
water-shed	1
to	1
another;	1
partly	1
because	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
freshwater	1
animals	1
are	1
descended	1
from	1
types	1
which	1
make	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
seashore	1
through	1
estuaries	1
and	1
marshes,	1
and	1
only	1
certain	1
kinds	1
of	1
constitution	1
could	1
survive	1
the	1
migration;	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
some	1
lakes	1
are	1
landlocked	1
dwindling	1
relics	1
of	1
ancient	1
seas,	1
and	1
similar	1
forms	1
again	1
would	1
survive	1
the	1
change.	1
A	1
typical	1
assemblage	1
of	1
freshwater	1
animals	1
would	1
include	1
many	1
Protozoa,	1
like	1
Amoebænd	1
the	1
Bell-Animalcules,	1
a	1
representative	1
of	1
one	1
family	1
of	1
sponges	1
(Spongillidæ	1
the	1
common	1
Hydra,	1
many	1
unsegmented	1
worms	1
(notably	1
Planarians	1
and	1
Nematodes),	1
many	1
Annelids	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
earthworms,	1
many	1
crustaceans,	1
insects,	1
and	1
mites,	1
many	1
bivalves	1
and	1
snails,	1
various	1
fishes,	1
a	1
newt	1
or	1
two,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
mud-turtle	1
or	1
in	1
warm	1
countries	1
a	1
huge	1
Crocodilian,	1
various	1
interesting	1
birds	1
like	1
the	1
water-ouzel	1
or	1
dipper,	1
and	1
mammals	1
like	1
the	1
water-vole	1
and	1
the	1
water-shrew.	1
Freshwater	1
animals	1
have	1
to	1
face	1
certain	1
difficulties,	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
drought,	1
frost,	1
and	1
being	1
washed	1
away	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
flood.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
interesting	1
study	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
an	1
inquiry	1
into	1
the	1
adaptations	1
by	1
which	1
freshwater	1
animals	1
overcome	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
situation.	1
We	1
cannot	1
give	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
few	1
illustrations.	1
(1)	1
Drought	1
is	1
circumvented	1
by	1
the	1
capacity	1
that	1
many	1
freshwater	1
animals	1
have	1
of	1
lying	1
low	1
and	1
saying	1
nothing.	1
Thus	1
the	1
African	1
mudfish	1
may	1
spend	1
half	1
the	1
year	1
encased	1
in	1
the	1
mud,	1
and	1
many	1
minute	1
crustaceans	1
can	1
survive	1
being	1
dried	1
up	1
for	1
years.	1
(2)	1
Escape	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
frozen	1
hard	1
in	1
the	1
pool	1
is	1
largely	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
unique	1
property	1
of	1
water	1
that	1
it	1
expands	1
as	1
it	1
approaches	1
the	1
freezing-point.	1
Thus	1
the	1
colder	1
water	1
rises	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
forms	1
or	1
adds	1
to	1
the	1
protecting	1
blanket	1
of	1
ice.	1
The	1
warmer	1
water	1
remains	1
unfrozen	1
at	1
the	1
bottom,	1
and	1
the	1
animals	1
live	1
on.	1
(3)	1
The	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
washed	1
away,	1
e.g.	1
to	1
the	1
sea,	1
is	1
lessened	1
by	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
gripping,	1
grappling,	1
and	1
anchoring	1
structures,	1
and	1
by	1
shortening	1
the	1
juvenile	1
stages	1
when	1
the	1
risks	1
are	1
greatest.	1
V.	1
THE	1
DRY	1
LAND	1
Over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
animal	1
life	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
attempts	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
on	1
to	1
terra	1
firma,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
have	1
been	1
successful,	1
notably	1
those	1
made	1
(1)	1
by	1
worms,	1
(2)	1
by	1
air-breathing	1
Arthropods,	1
and	1
(3)	1
by	1
amphibians.	1
In	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
by	1
animals,	1
we	1
must	1
recognise	1
the	1
indispensable	1
rôof	1
plants	1
in	1
preparing	1
the	1
way.	1
The	1
dry	1
ground	1
would	1
have	1
proved	1
too	1
inhospitable	1
had	1
not	1
terrestrial	1
plants	1
begun	1
to	1
establish	1
themselves,	1
affording	1
food,	1
shelter,	1
and	1
humidity.	1
There	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
plants	1
before	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
earthworms,	1
which	1
feed	1
on	1
decaying	1
leaves	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
but	1
how	1
soon	1
was	1
the	1
debt	1
repaid	1
when	1
the	1
earthworms	1
began	1
their	1
worldwide	1
task	1
of	1
forming	1
vegetable	1
mould,	1
opening	1
up	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
their	1
burrows,	1
circulating	1
the	1
soil	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
their	1
castings,	1
and	1
bruising	1
the	1
particles	1
in	1
their	1
gizzard--certainly	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
mill	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Another	1
important	1
idea	1
is	1
that	1
littoral	1
haunts,	1
both	1
on	1
the	1
seashore	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
freshwaters,	1
afforded	1
the	1
necessary	1
apprenticeship	1
and	1
transitional	1
experience	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
strenuous	1
life	1
on	1
dry	1
land.	1
Much	1
that	1
was	1
perfected	1
on	1
land	1
had	1
its	1
beginnings	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
Let	1
us	1
inquire,	1
however,	1
what	1
the	1
passage	1
from	1
water	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
actually	1
implied.	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
briefly	1
discussed	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
article	1
(on	1
Evolution),	1
but	1
the	1
subject	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
great	1
interest	1
and	1
importance.	1
Difficulties	1
and	1
Results	1
of	1
the	1
Transition	1
from	1
Water	1
to	1
Land	1
Leaving	1
the	1
water	1
for	1
dry	1
land	1
implied	1
a	1
loss	1
in	1
freedom	1
of	1
movement,	1
for	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
animal	1
is	1
primarily	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Thus	1
it	1
became	1
essential	1
that	1
movements	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
rapid	1
and	1
very	1
precise,	1
needs	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
associate	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
fine	1
cross-striped,	1
quickly	1
contracting	1
muscles,	1
and	1
also,	1
in	1
time,	1
their	1
multiplication	1
into	1
very	1
numerous	1
separate	1
engines.	1
We	1
exercise	1
fifty-four	1
muscles	1
in	1
the	1
half-second	1
that	1
elapses	1
between	1
raising	1
the	1
heel	1
of	1
our	1
foot	1
in	1
walking	1
and	1
planting	1
it	1
firmly	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
again.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
rapid	1
precisely	1
controlled	1
movements	1
implied	1
an	1
improved	1
nervous	1
system,	1
for	1
the	1
brain	1
was	1
a	1
movement-controlling	1
organ	1
for	1
ages	1
before	1
it	1
did	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
thinking.	1
The	1
transition	1
to	1
terra	1
firma	1
also	1
involved	1
a	1
greater	1
compactness	1
of	1
body,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
great	1
friction	1
on	1
the	1
surface.	1
An	1
animal	1
like	1
the	1
jellyfish	1
is	1
unthinkable	1
on	1
land,	1
and	1
the	1
elongated	1
bodies	1
of	1
some	1
land	1
animals	1
like	1
centipedes	1
and	1
snakes	1
are	1
specially	1
adapted	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
"sprawl."	1
They	1
are	1
exceptions	1
that	1
prove	1
the	1
rule.	1
Getting	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land	1
meant	1
entering	1
a	1
kingdom	1
where	1
the	1
differences	1
between	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
between	1
summer	1
and	1
winter	1
are	1
more	1
felt	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
This	1
made	1
it	1
advantageous	1
to	1
have	1
protections	1
against	1
evaporation	1
and	1
loss	1
of	1
heat	1
and	1
other	1
such	1
dangers.	1
Hence	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
acquired	1
a	1
thickened	1
skin,	1
or	1
a	1
dead	1
cuticle,	1
or	1
a	1
shell,	1
or	1
a	1
growth	1
of	1
hair,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
In	1
many	1
cases	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
protection	1
before	1
the	1
winter	1
sets	1
in,	1
e.g.	1
by	1
growing	1
thicker	1
fur	1
or	1
by	1
accumulating	1
a	1
layer	1
of	1
fat	1
below	1
the	1
skin.	1
But	1
the	1
thickening	1
or	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
involved	1
a	1
partial	1
or	1
total	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
as	1
a	1
respiratory	1
surface.	1
There	1
is	1
more	1
oxygen	1
available	1
on	1
dry	1
land	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
readily	1
captured.	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
moist	1
internal	1
surfaces	1
for	1
capturing	1
the	1
oxygen	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
into	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
lung.	1
A	1
unique	1
solution	1
was	1
offered	1
by	1
Tracheate	1
Arthropods,	1
such	1
as	1
Peripatus,	1
Centipedes,	1
Millipedes,	1
and	1
Insects,	1
where	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
carried	1
to	1
every	1
hole	1
and	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
a	1
ramifying	1
system	1
of	1
air-tubes	1
or	1
tracheæIn	1
most	1
animals	1
the	1
blood	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
air,	1
in	1
insects	1
the	1
air	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
blood.	1
In	1
the	1
Robber-Crab,	1
which	1
has	1
migrated	1
from	1
the	1
shore	1
inland,	1
the	1
dry	1
air	1
is	1
absorbed	1
by	1
vascular	1
tufts	1
growing	1
under	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
gill-cover.	1
The	1
problem	1
of	1
disposing	1
of	1
eggs	1
or	1
young	1
ones	1
is	1
obviously	1
much	1
more	1
difficult	1
on	1
land	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
For	1
the	1
water	1
offers	1
an	1
immediate	1
cradle,	1
whereas	1
on	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
dangers,	1
e.g.	1
of	1
drought,	1
extremes	1
of	1
temperature,	1
and	1
hungry	1
sharp-eyed	1
enemies,	1
which	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
circumvented.	1
So	1
we	1
find	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
land	1
animals	1
hide	1
their	1
eggs	1
or	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
in	1
holes	1
and	1
nests,	1
on	1
herbs	1
and	1
on	1
trees.	1
Some	1
carry	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
about	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
born,	1
like	1
the	1
Surinam	1
toad	1
and	1
the	1
kangaroo,	1
while	1
others	1
have	1
prolonged	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
ante-natal	1
life	1
during	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
develop	1
in	1
safety	1
within	1
their	1
mother,	1
and	1
in	1
very	1
intimate	1
partnership	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
placental	1
mammals.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
pioneer	1
animal	1
called	1
Peripatus,	1
which	1
bridges	1
the	1
gap	1
between	1
worms	1
and	1
insects,	1
carries	1
its	1
young	1
for	1
almost	1
a	1
year	1
before	1
birth.	1
Enough	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
successive	1
conquests	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
had	1
great	1
evolutionary	1
results.	1
It	1
is	1
hardly	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
invasion	1
which	1
the	1
Amphibians	1
led	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
better	1
brains,	1
more	1
controlled	1
activities,	1
and	1
higher	1
expressions	1
of	1
family	1
life.	1

VI.	1
THE	1
AIR	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
animals	1
thoroughly	1
aerial,	1
but	1
many	1
insects	1
spend	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
adult	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
free	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
swift	1
hardly	1
pauses	1
in	1
its	1
flight	1
from	1
dawn	1
to	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
summer	1
day,	1
alighting	1
only	1
for	1
brief	1
moments	1
at	1
the	1
nest	1
to	1
deliver	1
insects	1
to	1
the	1
young.	1
All	1
the	1
active	1
life	1
of	1
bats	1
certainly	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
aerial.	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
haunt	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
be	1
conquered,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
inquire	1
what	1
the	1
conquest	1
implied.	1
(1)	1
It	1
meant	1
transcending	1
the	1
radical	1
difficulty	1
of	1
terrestrial	1
life	1
which	1
confines	1
the	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
dry	1
land	1
to	1
moving	1
on	1
one	1
plane,	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
But	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
flight	1
brought	1
its	1
possessors	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
universal	1
freedom	1
of	1
movement	1
which	1
water	1
animals	1
enjoy.	1
When	1
we	1
watch	1
a	1
sparrow	1
rise	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
cat	1
has	1
completed	1
her	1
stealthy	1
stalking,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
flight	1
implies	1
an	1
enormous	1
increase	1
of	1
safety.	1
(2)	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
flight	1
also	1
opened	1
up	1
new	1
possibilities	1
of	1
following	1
the	1
prey,	1
of	1
exploring	1
new	1
territories,	1
of	1
prospecting	1
for	1
water.	1
(3)	1
Of	1
great	1
importance	1
too	1
was	1
the	1
practicability	1
of	1
placing	1
the	1
eggs	1
and	1
the	1
young,	1
perhaps	1
in	1
a	1
nest,	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
inaccessible	1
to	1
most	1
enemies.	1
When	1
one	1
thinks	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
rooks'	1
nests	1
swaying	1
on	1
the	1
tree-tops	1
express	1
the	1
climax	1
of	1
a	1
brilliant	1
experiment.	1
(4)	1
The	1
crowning	1
advantage	1
was	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
migrating,	1
of	1
conquering	1
time	1
(by	1
circumventing	1
the	1
arid	1
summer	1
and	1
the	1
severe	1
winter)	1
and	1
of	1
conquering	1
space	1
(by	1
passing	1
quickly	1
from	1
one	1
country	1
to	1
another	1
and	1
sometimes	1
almost	1
girdling	1
the	1
globe).	1
There	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
acquisitions	1
that	1
have	1
meant	1
more	1
to	1
their	1
possessors	1
than	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
flight.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
key	1
opening	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
freedom.	1
The	1
problem	1
of	1
flight,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
chapter,	1
has	1
been	1
solved	1
four	1
times,	1
and	1
the	1
solution	1
has	1
been	1
different	1
in	1
each	1
case.	1
The	1
four	1
solutions	1
are	1
those	1
offered	1
by	1
insects,	1
extinct	1
Pterodactyls,	1
birds,	1
and	1
bats.	1
Moreover,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
pointed	1
out,	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
numerous	1
attempts	1
at	1
flight	1
which	1
remain	1
glorious	1
failures,	1
notably	1
the	1
flying	1
fishes,	1
which	1
take	1
a	1
great	1
leap	1
and	1
hold	1
their	1
pectoral	1
fins	1
taut;	1
the	1
Flying	1
Tree-Toad,	1
whose	1
webbed	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes	1
form	1
a	1
parachute;	1
the	1
Flying	1
Lizard	1
(_Draco	1
volans_),	1
which	1
has	1
its	1
skin	1
pushed	1
out	1
on	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
greatly	1
elongated	1
mobile	1
ribs;	1
and	1
various	1
"flying"	1
mammals,	1
e.g.	1
Flying	1
Phalangers	1
and	1
Flying	1
Squirrels,	1
which	1
take	1
great	1
swooping	1
leaps	1
from	1
tree	1
to	1
tree.	1
The	1
wings	1
of	1
an	1
insect	1
are	1
hollow	1
flattened	1
sacs	1
which	1
grow	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
upper	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
rings	1
of	1
the	1
region	1
called	1
the	1
thorax.	1
They	1
are	1
worked	1
by	1
powerful	1
muscles,	1
and	1
are	1
supported,	1
like	1
a	1
fan,	1
by	1
ribs	1
of	1
chitin,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
accompanied	1
by	1
air-tubes,	1
blood-channels,	1
and	1
nerves.	1
The	1
insect's	1
body	1
is	1
lightly	1
built	1
and	1
very	1
perfectly	1
aerated,	1
and	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
insect's	1
flight	1
is	1
the	1
extremely	1
rapid	1
striking	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
lightly	1
built	1
elastic	1
wings.	1
Many	1
an	1
insect	1
has	1
over	1
two	1
hundred	1
strokes	1
of	1
its	1
wings	1
in	1
one	1
_second_.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
many	1
cases,	1
the	1
familiar	1
hum,	1
comparable	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
scale	1
to	1
that	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
rapidly	1
revolving	1
blades	1
of	1
an	1
aeroplane's	1
propeller.	1
For	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
a	1
bee	1
can	1
outfly	1
a	1
pigeon,	1
but	1
few	1
insects	1
can	1
fly	1
far,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
easily	1
blown	1
away	1
or	1
blown	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
wind.	1
Dragon-flies	1
and	1
bees	1
may	1
be	1
cited	1
as	1
examples	1
of	1
insects	1
that	1
often	1
fly	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
miles.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
exceptional,	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
shortness	1
of	1
insect	1
flight	1
is	1
an	1
important	1
fact	1
for	1
man	1
since	1
it	1
limits	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
insects	1
like	1
house-flies	1
and	1
mosquitoes	1
which	1
are	1
vehicles	1
of	1
typhoid	1
fever	1
and	1
malaria	1
respectively.	1
The	1
most	1
primitive	1
insects	1
(spring-tails	1
and	1
bristle-tails)	1
show	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
wings,	1
while	1
fleas	1
and	1
lice	1
have	1
become	1
secondarily	1
wingless.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
some	1
insects	1
only	1
fly	1
once	1
in	1
their	1
lifetime,	1
namely,	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
mating.	1
The	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
insect's	1
wing	1
remains	1
quite	1
obscure,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
insects	1
could	1
run,	1
leap,	1
and	1
parachute	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
actually	1
fly.	1
The	1
extinct	1
Flying	1
Dragons	1
or	1
Pterodactyls	1
had	1
their	1
golden	1
age	1
in	1
the	1
Cretaceous	1
era,	1
after	1
which	1
they	1
disappeared,	1
leaving	1
no	1
descendants.	1
A	1
fold	1
of	1
skin	1
was	1
spread	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
by	1
the	1
enormously	1
elongated	1
outermost	1
finger	1
(usually	1
regarded	1
as	1
corresponding	1
to	1
our	1
little	1
finger);	1
it	1
was	1
continued	1
to	1
the	1
hind-legs	1
and	1
thence	1
to	1
the	1
tail.	1
It	1
is	1
unlikely	1
that	1
the	1
Pterodactyls	1
could	1
fly	1
far,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
at	1
most	1
a	1
weak	1
keel	1
on	1
their	1
breast-bone;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
show	1
a	1
marked	1
fusion	1
of	1
dorsal	1
vertebræwhich,	1
as	1
in	1
flying	1
birds,	1
must	1
have	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
firm	1
fulcrum	1
for	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
wings.	1
The	1
quaint	1
creatures	1
varied	1
from	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
sparrow	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
magnificent	1
spread	1
of	1
15-20	1
feet	1
from	1
tip	1
to	1
tip	1
of	1
the	1
wings.	1
They	1
were	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
all	1
flying	1
creatures.	1
The	1
bird's	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
flight,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
discussed	1
separately,	1
is	1
centred	1
in	1
the	1
feather,	1
which	1
forms	1
a	1
coherent	1
vane	1
for	1
striking	1
the	1
air.	1
In	1
Pterodactyl	1
and	1
bat	1
the	1
wing	1
is	1
a	1
web-wing	1
or	1
patagium,	1
and	1
a	1
small	1
web	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bird's	1
wing.	1
But	1
the	1
bird's	1
patagium	1
is	1
unimportant,	1
and	1
the	1
bird's	1
wing	1
is	1
on	1
an	1
evolutionary	1
tack	1
of	1
its	1
own--a	1
fore-limb	1
transformed	1
for	1
bearing	1
the	1
feathers	1
of	1
flight.	1
Feathers	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way	1
comparable	1
to	1
the	1
scales	1
of	1
reptiles,	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way,	1
and	1
no	1
transition	1
stage	1
is	1
known	1
between	1
the	1
two.	1
Birds	1
evolved	1
from	1
a	1
bipedal	1
Dinosaur	1
stock,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
noticed	1
already,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
their	1
ascent	1
by	1
taking	1
running	1
leaps	1
along	1
the	1
ground,	1
flapping	1
their	1
scaly	1
fore-limbs,	1
and	1
balancing	1
themselves	1
in	1
kangaroo-like	1
fashion	1
with	1
an	1
extended	1
tail.	1
A	1
second	1
chapter	1
was	1
probably	1
an	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship,	1
during	1
which	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
fine	1
art	1
of	1
parachuting--a	1
persistence	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
pigeon	1
"gliding"	1
from	1
the	1
dovecot	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
birds	1
that	1
the	1
mastery	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
reaches	1
its	1
climax,	1
and	1
the	1
mysterious	1
"sailing"	1
of	1
the	1
albatross	1
and	1
the	1
vulture	1
is	1
surely	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
locomotor	1
triumph	1
that	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
achieved.	1
Without	1
any	1
apparent	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
wings,	1
the	1
bird	1
sails	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
wind,	1
around	1
the	1
ship	1
and	1
in	1
majestic	1
spirals	1
in	1
the	1
sky,	1
probably	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
currents	1
of	1
air	1
of	1
different	1
velocities,	1
and	1
continually	1
changing	1
energy	1
of	1
position	1
into	1
energy	1
of	1
motion	1
as	1
it	1
sinks,	1
and	1
energy	1
of	1
motion	1
into	1
energy	1
of	1
position	1
as	1
it	1
rises.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
some	1
dragon-flies	1
are	1
also	1
able	1
to	1
"sail."	1
The	1
web-wing	1
of	1
bats	1
involves	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fore-arm.	1
The	1
double	1
fold	1
of	1
skin	1
begins	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
neck,	1
passes	1
along	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
arm,	1
skips	1
the	1
thumb,	1
and	1
is	1
continued	1
over	1
the	1
elongated	1
palm-bones	1
and	1
fingers	1
to	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
hind-legs,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
tail	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
tail.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
the	1
bat's	1
skeleton	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
lightly	1
built	1
as	1
in	1
birds,	1
that	1
the	1
breast-bone	1
has	1
likewise	1
a	1
keel	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
insertion	1
of	1
the	1
pectoral	1
muscles,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
solidifying	1
of	1
the	1
vertebræf	1
the	1
back,	1
affording	1
as	1
in	1
birds	1
a	1
firm	1
basis	1
for	1
the	1
wing	1
action.	1
Such	1
similar	1
adaptations	1
to	1
similar	1
needs,	1
occurring	1
in	1
animals	1
not	1
nearly	1
related	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
are	1
called	1
"convergences,"	1
and	1
form	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
study.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
adaptations	1
which	1
the	1
bat	1
shares	1
with	1
the	1
flying	1
bird,	1
it	1
has	1
many	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
There	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
nerve-endings	1
on	1
the	1
wing,	1
and	1
often	1
also	1
on	1
special	1
skin-leaves	1
about	1
the	1
ears	1
and	1
nose,	1
that	1
the	1
bat	1
flying	1
in	1
the	1
dusk	1
does	1
not	1
knock	1
against	1
branches	1
or	1
other	1
obstacles.	1
Some	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
helped	1
by	1
the	1
echoes	1
of	1
its	1
high-pitched	1
voice,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
exquisite	1
tactility.	1
That	1
it	1
usually	1
produces	1
only	1
a	1
single	1
young	1
one	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
is	1
a	1
clear	1
adaptation	1
to	1
flight,	1
and	1
similarly	1
the	1
sharp,	1
mountain-top-like	1
cusps	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
teeth	1
are	1
adapted	1
in	1
insectivorous	1
bats	1
for	1
crunching	1
insects.	1
Whether	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
triumphant	1
flight	1
of	1
birds,	1
reaching	1
a	1
climax	1
in	1
migration,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
marvel	1
that	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
the	1
earth--as	1
a	1
mammal	1
essentially	1
is--should	1
evolve	1
such	1
a	1
mastery	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
bats,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
repeated	1
but	1
splendid	1
failures	1
which	1
parachuting	1
animals	1
illustrate,	1
we	1
gain	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
insurgence	1
of	1
living	1
creatures	1
in	1
their	1
characteristic	1
endeavour	1
after	1
fuller	1
well-being.	1
We	1
have	1
said	1
enough	1
to	1
show	1
how	1
well	1
adapted	1
many	1
animals	1
are	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
particular	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
haunt	1
which	1
they	1
tenant.	1
But	1
difficulties	1
and	1
limitations	1
are	1
ever	1
arising	1
afresh,	1
and	1
so	1
one	1
fitness	1
follows	1
on	1
another.	1
It	1
is	1
natural,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
pass	1
to	1
the	1
frequent	1
occurrence	1
of	1
protective	1
resemblance,	1
camouflage,	1
and	1
mimicry--the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
article.	1

IV	1
THE	1
STRUGGLE	1
FOR	1
EXISTENCE	1
ANIMAL	1
AND	1
BIRD	1
MIMICRY	1
AND	1
DISGUISE	1
§	1
1	1
For	1
every	1
animal	1
one	1
discovers	1
when	1
observing	1
carefully,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
ten	1
unseen.	1
This	1
is	1
partly	1
because	1
many	1
animals	1
burrow	1
in	1
the	1
ground	1
or	1
get	1
in	1
underneath	1
things	1
and	1
into	1
dark	1
corners,	1
being	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
cryptozoic	1
or	1
elusive.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
partly	1
because	1
many	1
animals	1
put	1
on	1
disguise	1
or	1
have	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
acquired	1
a	1
garment	1
of	1
invisibility.	1
This	1
is	1
very	1
common	1
among	1
animals,	1
and	1
it	1
occurs	1
in	1
many	1
forms	1
and	1
degrees.	1
The	1
reason	1
why	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
common	1
is	1
because	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
keen,	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
why	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
is	1
keen	1
are	1
four.	1
First,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
tendency	1
to	1
over-population	1
in	1
many	1
animals,	1
especially	1
those	1
of	1
low	1
degree.	1
Second,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
nature	1
involves	1
nutritive	1
chains	1
or	1
successive	1
incarnations,	1
one	1
animal	1
depending	1
upon	1
another	1
for	1
food,	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
run	1
on	1
plants;	1
thirdly,	1
every	1
vigorous	1
animal	1
is	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
hustler,	1
given	1
to	1
insurgence	1
and	1
sticking	1
out	1
his	1
elbows.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
fourth	1
great	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence,	1
namely,	1
the	1
frequent	1
changefulness	1
of	1
the	1
physical	1
environment,	1
which	1
forces	1
animals	1
to	1
answer	1
back	1
or	1
die;	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
reasons	1
have	1
most	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
common	1
assumption	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
disguise.	1
Even	1
when	1
an	1
animal	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
sense	1
a	1
weakling,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
advantageous	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
inconspicuous	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
resting	1
or	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
its	1
young.	1
Our	1
problem	1
is	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
elusiveness,	1
so	1
far	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
that	1
depends	1
on	1
likeness	1
to	1
surroundings,	1
on	1
protective	1
resemblance	1
to	1
other	1
objects,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
reaches	1
on	1
true	1
mimicry.	1
Colour	1
Permanently	1
Like	1
That	1
of	1
Surroundings	1
Many	1
animals	1
living	1
on	1
sandy	1
places	1
have	1
a	1
light-brown	1
colour,	1
as	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
some	1
lizards	1
and	1
snakes.	1
The	1
green	1
lizard	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
grass	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
tree-snake	1
is	1
inconspicuous	1
among	1
the	1
branches.	1
The	1
spotted	1
leopard	1
is	1
suited	1
to	1
the	1
interrupted	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
hard	1
to	1
tell	1
where	1
the	1
jungle	1
ends	1
and	1
the	1
striped	1
tiger	1
begins.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
better	1
case	1
than	1
the	1
hare	1
or	1
the	1
partridge	1
sitting	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
ploughed	1
field.	1
Even	1
a	1
donkey	1
grazing	1
in	1
the	1
dusk	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
readily	1
heard	1
than	1
seen.	1
The	1
experiment	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
tethering	1
the	1
green	1
variety	1
of	1
Praying	1
Mantis	1
on	1
green	1
herbage,	1
fastening	1
them	1
with	1
silk	1
threads.	1
They	1
escape	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
birds.	1
The	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
when	1
the	1
brown	1
variety	1
is	1
tethered	1
on	1
withered	1
herbage.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
green	1
ones	1
are	1
put	1
on	1
brown	1
plants,	1
or	1
the	1
brown	1
ones	1
on	1
green	1
plants,	1
the	1
birds	1
pick	1
them	1
off.	1
Similarly,	1
out	1
of	1
300	1
chickens	1
in	1
a	1
field,	1
240	1
white	1
or	1
black	1
and	1
therefore	1
conspicuous,	1
60	1
spotted	1
and	1
inconspicuous,	1
24	1
were	1
soon	1
picked	1
off	1
by	1
crows,	1
but	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
spotted.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
proportion	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
if	1
the	1
mortality	1
had	1
been	1
fortuitous.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
often	1
pays	1
an	1
animal	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
its	1
habitual	1
surroundings,	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
piece	1
of	1
scenery	1
if	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
not	1
moving.	1
It	1
is	1
safe	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
wide	1
departures	1
from	1
the	1
safest	1
coloration	1
will	1
be	1
wiped	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Nature's	1
ceaseless	1
sifting.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
credulous,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
three	1
cautions	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
in	1
mind.	1
(1)	1
An	1
animal	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
like	1
its	1
surroundings	1
without	1
there	1
being	1
any	1
protection	1
implied.	1
The	1
arrow-worms	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
are	1
as	1
clear	1
as	1
glass,	1
and	1
so	1
are	1
many	1
open-sea	1
animals.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
because	1
their	1
tissues	1
are	1
so	1
watery,	1
with	1
a	1
specific	1
gravity	1
near	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
salt	1
water.	1
And	1
the	1
invisibility	1
does	1
not	1
save	1
them,	1
always	1
or	1
often,	1
from	1
being	1
swallowed	1
by	1
larger	1
animals	1
that	1
gather	1
the	1
harvest	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
(2)	1
Among	1
the	1
cleverer	1
animals	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
creature	1
sometimes	1
sought	1
out	1
a	1
spot	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
inconspicuous.	1
A	1
spider	1
may	1
place	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
patch	1
of	1
lichen,	1
where	1
its	1
self-effacement	1
is	1
complete.	1
Perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
comfortable	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
safer	1
to	1
rest	1
in	1
surroundings	1
the	1
general	1
colour	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
animal's	1
body.	1
(3)	1
The	1
fishes	1
that	1
live	1
among	1
the	1
coral-reefs	1
are	1
startling	1
in	1
their	1
brilliant	1
coloration,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
different	1
patterns.	1
To	1
explain	1
this	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
suggested	1
that	1
these	1
fishes	1
are	1
so	1
safe	1
among	1
the	1
mazy	1
passages	1
and	1
endless	1
nooks	1
of	1
the	1
reefs,	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
well	1
afford	1
to	1
wear	1
any	1
colour	1
that	1
suits	1
their	1
constitution.	1
In	1
some	1
cases	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
true,	1
but	1
naturalists	1
who	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
diving	1
suit	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
coral	1
have	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
each	1
kind	1
of	1
fish	1
is	1
particularly	1
suited	1
to	1
some	1
particular	1
place,	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
are	1
suited	1
for	1
midday	1
work	1
and	1
others	1
for	1
evening	1
work.	1
Sometimes	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
Box	1
and	1
Cox	1
arrangement	1
by	1
which	1
two	1
different	1
fishes	1
utilise	1
the	1
same	1
corner	1
at	1
different	1
times.	1

§	1
2	1
Gradual	1
Change	1
of	1
Colour	1
The	1
common	1
shore-crab	1
shows	1
many	1
different	1
colours	1
and	1
mottlings,	1
especially	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
young.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
green	1
or	1
grey,	1
red	1
or	1
brown,	1
and	1
so	1
forth,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
in	1
admirable	1
adjustment	1
to	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
rock-pool	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
living.	1
Experiments,	1
which	1
require	1
extension,	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
crab	1
has	1
moulted,	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
very	1
often	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
young,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
shell	1
tends	1
to	1
harmonise	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
colour	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
seaweed.	1
How	1
this	1
is	1
brought	1
about,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
The	1
colour	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
change	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
moult,	1
and	1
not	1
then	1
unless	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
reason	1
for	1
it.	1
A	1
full-grown	1
shore-crab	1
is	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
itself,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
notice,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
coloration	1
is	1
mainly	1
among	1
the	1
small	1
individuals,	1
who	1
have,	1
of	1
course,	1
a	1
much	1
less	1
secure	1
position.	1
It	1
is	1
possible,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
the	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
surroundings	1
admits	1
of	1
more	1
successful	1
hunting,	1
enabling	1
the	1
small	1
crab	1
to	1
take	1
its	1
victim	1
unawares.	1
Professor	1
Poulton's	1
experiments	1
with	1
the	1
caterpillars	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
tortoise-shell	1
butterfly	1
showed	1
that	1
in	1
black	1
surroundings	1
the	1
pupæend	1
to	1
be	1
darker,	1
in	1
white	1
surroundings	1
lighter,	1
in	1
gilded	1
boxes	1
golden;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
other	1
cases.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
surrounding	1
colour	1
affects	1
the	1
caterpillars	1
through	1
the	1
skin	1
during	1
a	1
sensitive	1
period--the	1
twenty	1
hours	1
immediately	1
preceding	1
the	1
last	1
twelve	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
larval	1
state.	1
The	1
result	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
quiescent	1
pupæess	1
conspicuous	1
during	1
the	1
critical	1
time	1
of	1
metamorphosis.	1
The	1
physiology	1
of	1
this	1
sympathetic	1
colouring	1
remains	1
obscure.	1
Seasonal	1
Change	1
of	1
Colouring	1
The	1
ptarmigan	1
moults	1
three	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
Its	1
summer	1
plumage	1
is	1
rather	1
grouselike	1
above,	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
rufous	1
brown;	1
the	1
back	1
becomes	1
much	1
more	1
grey	1
in	1
autumn;	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
feathers	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
plumage	1
are	1
white.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
they	1
develop	1
without	1
any	1
pigment	1
and	1
with	1
numerous	1
gas-bubbles	1
in	1
their	1
cells.	1
Now	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
white	1
winter	1
plumage	1
makes	1
the	1
ptarmigan	1
very	1
inconspicuous	1
amidst	1
the	1
snow.	1
Sometimes	1
one	1
comes	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
crouching	1
bird	1
without	1
seeing	1
it,	1
and	1
this	1
garment	1
of	1
invisibility	1
may	1
save	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
hungry	1
eyes	1
of	1
golden	1
eagles.	1
Similarly	1
the	1
brown	1
stoat	1
becomes	1
the	1
white	1
ermine,	1
mainly	1
by	1
the	1
growth,	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
suit	1
of	1
white	1
fur,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
hare.	1
The	1
ermine	1
is	1
all	1
white	1
except	1
the	1
black	1
tip	1
of	1
its	1
tail;	1
the	1
mountain	1
hare	1
in	1
its	1
winter	1
dress	1
is	1
all	1
white	1
save	1
the	1
black	1
tips	1
of	1
its	1
ears.	1
In	1
some	1
cases,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
mountain	1
hare,	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
individual	1
hairs	1
may	1
turn	1
white,	1
by	1
a	1
loss	1
of	1
pigment,	1
as	1
may	1
occur	1
in	1
man.	1
According	1
to	1
Metchnikoff,	1
the	1
wandering	1
amoeboid	1
cells	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
called	1
phagocytes,	1
may	1
creep	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
hairs	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
again	1
with	1
microscopic	1
burdens	1
of	1
pigment.	1
The	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
pigment	1
is	1
taken	1
by	1
gas-bubbles,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
causes	1
the	1
whiteness.	1
In	1
no	1
animals	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
white	1
_pigment_;	1
the	1
white	1
_colour_	1
is	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
snow	1
or	1
foam,	1
it	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
complete	1
reflection	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
innumerable	1
minute	1
surfaces	1
of	1
crystals	1
or	1
bubbles.	1

The	1
mountain	1
hare	1
may	1
escape	1
the	1
fox	1
the	1
more	1
readily	1
because	1
its	1
whiteness	1
makes	1
it	1
so	1
inconspicuous	1
against	1
a	1
background	1

and	1
yet,	1
at	1

we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
creature	1
standing	1
out	1
like	1
a	1

So	1
it	1

it	1

upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
In	1
both	1
cases,	1
however,	1
the	1
probability	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
constitutional	1
rhythm	1
which	1
leads	1
to	1
white	1
hair	1
in	1
winter	1
has	1
been	1
fostered	1
and	1
fixed	1
for	1
a	1
reason	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
protection.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
warm-blooded	1
creature,	1
whether	1
bird	1
or	1
mammal,	1
the	1
physiologically	1
best	1
dress	1
is	1
a	1
white	1
one,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
less	1
radiation	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
animal	1
heat	1
from	1
white	1
plumage	1
or	1
white	1
pelage	1
than	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
colour.	1
The	1
quality	1
of	1
warm-bloodedness	1
is	1
a	1
prerogative	1
of	1
birds	1
and	1
mammals,	1
and	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
body	1
keeps	1
an	1
almost	1
constant	1
temperature,	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
year	1
in	1
and	1
year	1
out.	1
This	1
is	1
effected	1
by	1
automatic	1
internal	1
adjustments	1
which	1
regulate	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
heat,	1
chiefly	1
from	1
the	1
muscles,	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
heat,	1
chiefly	1
through	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
lungs.	1
The	1
chief	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
internal	1
heat	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
facilitates	1
the	1
smooth	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
chemical	1
processes	1
on	1
which	1
life	1
depends.	1
If	1
the	1
temperature	1
falls,	1
as	1
in	1
hibernating	1
mammals	1
(whose	1
warm-bloodedness	1
is	1
imperfect),	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
the	1
vital	1
process	1
is	1
slowed	1
down--sometimes	1
dangerously.	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
white	1
coat	1
helps	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
creature.	1
§	1

Rapid	1
Colour-change	1
Bony	1
flat-fishes,	1
like	1
plaice	1
and	1
sole,	1
have	1
a	1
remarkable	1
power	1
of	1
adjusting	1
their	1
hue	1
and	1
pattern	1
to	1
the	1
surrounding	1
gravel	1
and	1
sand,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
them	1
even	1
when	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
there.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
also	1
very	1
quick	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
sand	1
over	1
their	1
upturned	1
side,	1
so	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
eyes	1
are	1
left	1
showing.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
exactness	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
often	1
adjust	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
substratum	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
lie;	1
they	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
within	1
limits	1
in	1
experimental	1
conditions	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
placed	1
on	1
a	1
quite	1
artificial	1
floor.	1
As	1
these	1
fishes	1
are	1
very	1
palatable	1
and	1
are	1
much	1
sought	1
after	1
by	1
such	1
enemies	1
as	1
cormorants	1
and	1
otters,	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probably	1
that	1
their	1
power	1
of	1
self-effacement	1
often	1
saves	1
their	1
life.	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
effected	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
within	1
a	1
minute.	1
In	1
these	1
self-effacing	1
flat-fishes	1
we	1
know	1
with	1
some	1
precision	1
what	1
happens.	1
The	1
adjustment	1
of	1
colour	1
and	1
pattern	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
size,	1
shape,	1
and	1
position	1
of	1
mobile	1
pigment-cells	1
(chromatophores)	1
and	1
the	1
skin.	1
But	1
what	1
makes	1
the	1
pigment-cells	1
change?	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
blind	1
flat-fish	1
does	1
not	1
change	1
its	1
colour	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
answer.	1
The	1
colour	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
surroundings	1
must	1
affect	1
the	1
eye.	1
The	1
message	1
travels	1
by	1
the	1
optic	1
nerve	1
to	1
the	1
brain;	1
from	1
the	1
brain,	1
instead	1
of	1
passing	1
down	1
the	1
spinal	1
cord,	1
the	1
message	1
travels	1
down	1
the	1
chain	1
of	1
sympathetic	1
ganglia.	1
From	1
these	1
it	1
passes	1
along	1
the	1
nerves	1
which	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
spinal	1
cord	1
and	1
control	1
the	1
skin.	1
Thus	1
the	1
message	1
reaches	1
the	1
colour-cells	1
in	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
before	1
you	1
have	1
carefully	1
read	1
these	1
lines	1
the	1
flat-fish	1
has	1
slipped	1
on	1
its	1
Gyges	1
ring	1
and	1
become	1
invisible.	1
The	1
same	1
power	1
of	1
rapid	1
colour-change	1
is	1
seen	1
in	1
cuttlefishes,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
nervous	1
excitement,	1
though	1
it	1
sometimes	1
helps	1
to	1
conceal.	1
It	1
occurs	1
with	1
much	1
subtlety	1
in	1
the	1
Æop	1
prawn,	1
Hippolyte,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
brown	1
on	1
a	1
brown	1
seaweed,	1
green	1
on	1
sea-lettuce	1
or	1
sea-grass,	1
red	1
on	1
red	1
seaweed,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
through	1
an	1
extensive	1
repertory.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
background,	1
[Professor	1
Gamble	1
writes]	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
mixture	1
of	1
the	1
pigments	1
compounded	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
close	1
reproduction	1
both	1
of	1
its	1
colour	1
and	1
its	1
pattern.	1
A	1
sweep	1
of	1
the	1
shrimp	1
net	1
detaches	1
a	1
battalion	1
of	1
these	1
sleeping	1
prawns,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
the	1
motley	1
into	1
a	1
dish	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
choice	1
of	1
seaweed,	1
each	1
variety	1
after	1
its	1
kind	1
will	1
select	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
agrees	1
in	1
colour,	1
and	1
vanish.	1
Both	1
when	1
young	1
and	1
when	1
full-grown,	1
the	1
Æop	1
prawn	1
takes	1
on	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
its	1
immediate	1
surroundings.	1
At	1
nightfall	1
Hippolyte,	1
of	1
whatever	1
colour,	1
changes	1
to	1
a	1
transparent	1
azure	1
blue:	1
its	1
stolidity	1
gives	1
place	1
to	1
a	1
nervous	1
restlessness;	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
tremor	1
it	1
leaps	1
violently,	1
and	1
often	1
swims	1
actively	1
from	1
one	1
food-plant	1
to	1
another.	1
This	1
blue	1
fit	1
lasts	1
till	1
daybreak,	1
and	1
is	1
then	1
succeeded	1
by	1
the	1
prawn's	1
diurnal	1
tint.	1
Thus,	1
Professor	1
Gamble	1
continues,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
an	1
animal	1
may	1
express	1
a	1
nervous	1
rhythm.	1

The	1
Case	1
of	1
Chameleons	1
The	1
highest	1
level	1
at	1
which	1
rapid	1
colour-change	1
occurs	1
is	1
among	1
lizards,	1
and	1
the	1
finest	1
exhibition	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
chameleons.	1
These	1
quaint	1
creatures	1
are	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Africa;	1
but	1
they	1
occur	1
also	1
in	1
Andalusia,	1
Arabia,	1
Ceylon,	1
and	1
Southern	1
India.	1
They	1
are	1
adapted	1
for	1
life	1
on	1
trees,	1
where	1
they	1
hunt	1
insects	1
with	1
great	1
deliberateness	1
and	1
success.	1
The	1
protrusible	1
tongue,	1
ending	1
in	1
a	1
sticky	1
club,	1
can	1
be	1
shot	1
out	1
for	1
about	1
seven	1
inches	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
chameleon.	1
Their	1
hands	1
and	1
feet	1
are	1
split	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
grip	1
the	1
branches	1
firmly,	1
and	1
the	1
prehensile	1
tail	1
rivals	1
a	1
monkey's.	1
When	1
they	1
wish	1
they	1
can	1
make	1
themselves	1
very	1
slim,	1
contracting	1
the	1
body	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
readily	1
seen.	1
In	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
however,	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
practise	1
self-effacement,	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
reverse.	1
They	1
inflate	1
their	1
bodies,	1
having	1
not	1
only	1
large	1
lungs,	1
but	1
air-sacs	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
throat	1
bulges;	1
the	1
body	1
sways	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side;	1
and	1
the	1
creature	1
expresses	1
its	1
sentiments	1
in	1
a	1
hiss.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
colour-change	1
is	1
very	1
remarkable,	1
and	1
depends	1
partly	1
on	1
the	1
contraction	1
and	1
expansion	1
of	1
the	1
colour-cells	1
(chromatophores)	1
in	1
the	1
under-skin	1
(or	1
dermis)	1
and	1
partly	1
on	1
close-packed	1
refractive	1
granules	1
and	1
crystals	1
of	1
a	1
waste-product	1
called	1
guanin.	1
The	1
repertory	1
of	1
possible	1
colours	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
chameleon	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
animal	1
except	1
the	1
Æop	1
prawn.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
legend	1
of	1
a	1
chameleon	1
which	1
was	1
brown	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
box,	1
green	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
box,	1
and	1
blue	1
in	1
a	1
blue	1
box,	1
and	1
died	1
when	1
put	1
into	1
one	1
lined	1
with	1
tartan;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
animal	1
has	1
a	1
wide	1
range	1
of	1
colours.	1
The	1
so-called	1
"chameleon"	1
(_Anolis_)	1
of	1
North	1
America	1
is	1
so	1
sensitive	1
that	1
a	1
passing	1
cloud	1
makes	1
it	1
change	1
its	1
emerald	1
hue.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
a	1
chameleon	1
may	1
make	1
itself	1
more	1
inconspicuous	1
by	1
changing	1
its	1
colour,	1
being	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
light	1
on	1
its	1
eyes.	1
A	1
bright-green	1
hue	1
is	1
often	1
seen	1
on	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
sitting	1
among	1
strongly	1
illumined	1
green	1
leaves.	1
But	1
the	1
colour	1
also	1
changes	1
with	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
animal's	1
moods.	1
A	1
sudden	1
irritation	1
may	1
bring	1
about	1
a	1
rapid	1
change;	1
in	1
other	1
cases	1
the	1
transformation	1
comes	1
about	1
very	1
gradually.	1
When	1
the	1
colour-change	1
expresses	1
the	1
chameleon's	1
feelings	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
blushing,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
an	1
expansion	1
of	1
the	1
arteries	1
of	1
the	1
face,	1
allowing	1
more	1
blood	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
capillaries	1
of	1
the	1
under-skin.	1
The	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
chameleon	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
interesting	1
because	1
the	1
animal	1
has	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
tactics--self-effacement	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
bluffing	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
colour-change	1
sometimes	1
justifies	1
itself	1
by	1
driving	1
off	1
intruders.	1
Dr.	1
Cyril	1
Crossland	1
observed	1
that	1
a	1
chameleon	1
attacked	1
by	1
a	1
fox-terrier	1
"turned	1
round	1
and	1
opened	1
its	1
great	1
pink	1
mouth	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
advancing	1
dog,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
rapidly	1
changing	1
colour,	1
becoming	1
almost	1
black.	1
This	1
ruse	1
succeeded	1
every	1
time,	1
the	1
dog	1
turning	1
off	1
at	1
once."	1
In	1
natural	1
leafy	1
surroundings	1
the	1
startling	1
effect	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
greater--a	1
sudden	1
throwing	1
off	1
of	1
the	1
mantle	1
of	1
invisibility	1
and	1
the	1
exposure	1
of	1
a	1
conspicuous	1
black	1
body	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
red	1
mouth.	1
§	1

Likeness	1
to	1
Other	1
Things	1
Dr.	1
H.	1
O.	1
Forbes	1
tells	1
of	1
a	1
flat	1
spider	1
which	1
presents	1
a	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
bird's	1
dropping	1
on	1
a	1
leaf.	1
Years	1
after	1
he	1
first	1
found	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
watching	1
in	1
a	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
Far	1
East	1
when	1
his	1
eye	1
fell	1
on	1
a	1
leaf	1
before	1
him	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
blotched	1
by	1
a	1
bird.	1
He	1
wondered	1
idly	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
another	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
bird-dropping	1
spider	1
(_Ornithoscatoides	1
decipiens_),	1
and	1
drew	1
the	1
leaf	1
towards	1
him.	1
Instantaneously	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
characteristic	1
sharp	1
nip;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
spider	1
after	1
all!	1
Here	1
the	1
colour-resemblance	1
was	1
enhanced	1
by	1
a	1
form-resemblance.	1

pool	1
almost	1
invisible	1
against	1
their	1
background.	1
The	1
Stone	1
Curlews,	1
both	1
adult	1
and	1
young,	1
are	1
very	1
inconspicuous	1
among	1
the	1
stones	1
on	1
the	1
beach.]	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
it	1
profit	1
a	1
spider	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
bird-dropping?	1
Perhaps	1
because	1
it	1
thereby	1
escapes	1
attention;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
possibility.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
some	1
butterflies,	1
allied	1
to	1
our	1
Blues,	1
are	1
often	1
attracted	1
to	1
excrementitious	1
material,	1
and	1
the	1
spider	1
Dr.	1
Forbes	1
observed	1
had	1
actually	1
caught	1
its	1
victim.	1
This	1
is	1
borne	1
out	1
by	1
a	1
recent	1
observation	1
by	1
Dr.	1
D.	1
G.	1
H.	1
Carpenter,	1
who	1
found	1
a	1
Uganda	1
bug	1
closely	1
resembling	1
a	1
bird-dropping	1
on	1
sand.	1
The	1
bug	1
actually	1
settled	1
down	1
on	1
a	1
bird-dropping	1
on	1
sand,	1
and	1
caught	1
a	1
blue	1
butterfly	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
feed	1
there!	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
walking-stick	1
insects,	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
crickets	1
and	1
grasshoppers	1
(Orthoptera),	1
have	1
their	1
body	1
elongated	1
and	1
narrow,	1
like	1
a	1
thin	1
dry	1
branch,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
sticking	1
out	1
their	1
limbs	1
at	1
abrupt	1
and	1
diverse	1
angles,	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
resemblance	1
to	1
twigs	1
very	1
close	1
indeed.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
quaint	1
insects	1
rest	1
through	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
have	1
the	1
remarkable	1
habit	1
of	1
putting	1
themselves	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
kataleptic	1
state.	1
Many	1
creatures	1
turn	1
stiff	1
when	1
they	1
get	1
a	1
shock,	1
or	1
pass	1
suddenly	1
into	1
new	1
surroundings,	1
like	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
sand-hoppers	1
when	1
we	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
our	1
hand;	1
but	1
these	1
twig-insects	1
put	1
themselves	1
into	1
this	1
strange	1
state.	1
The	1
body	1
is	1
rocked	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
stiffens.	1
An	1
advantage	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
surprised	1
by	1
a	1
bird	1
or	1
a	1
lizard,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
betray	1
themselves	1
by	1
even	1
a	1
tremor.	1
Disguise	1
is	1
perfected	1
by	1
a	1
remarkable	1
habit,	1
a	1
habit	1
which	1
leads	1
us	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
series	1
of	1
different	1
ways	1
of	1
lying	1
low	1
and	1
saying	1
nothing	1
which	1
are	1
often	1
of	1
life-preserving	1
value.	1
The	1
top	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
series	1
is	1
seen	1
when	1
a	1
fox	1
plays	1
'possum.	1
The	1
leaf-butterfly	1
_Kallima_,	1
conspicuously	1
coloured	1
on	1
its	1
upper	1
surface,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
withered	1
leaf	1
when	1
it	1
settles	1
down	1
and	1
shows	1
the	1
under	1
side	1
of	1
its	1
wings.	1
Here,	1
again,	1
there	1
is	1
precise	1
form-resemblance,	1
for	1
the	1
nervures	1
on	1
the	1
wings	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
mid-rib	1
and	1
side	1
veins	1
on	1
a	1
leaf,	1
and	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
perfection	1
is	1
given	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
whitish	1
spots	1
which	1
look	1
exactly	1
like	1
the	1
discolorations	1
produced	1
by	1
lichens	1
on	1
leaves.	1
An	1
old	1
entomologist,	1
Mr.	1
Jenner	1
Weir,	1
confessed	1
that	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
pruned	1
off	1
a	1
caterpillar	1
on	1
a	1
bush	1
in	1
mistake	1
for	1
a	1
superfluous	1
twig,	1
for	1
many	1
brownish	1
caterpillars	1
fasten	1
themselves	1
by	1
their	1
posterior	1
claspers	1
and	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
thread	1
of	1
silk	1
from	1
their	1
mouth,	1
and	1
project	1
from	1
the	1
branch	1
at	1
a	1
twig-like	1
angle.	1
An	1
insect	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
a	1
sharp	1
prickle	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
soft	1
moss;	1
a	1
spider	1
may	1
look	1
precisely	1
like	1
a	1
tiny	1
knob	1
on	1
a	1
branch	1
or	1
a	1
fragment	1
of	1
lichen;	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sea-horses	1
(_Phyllopteryx_)	1
has	1
frond-like	1
tassels	1
on	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
its	1
body,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
looks	1
extraordinarily	1
like	1
the	1
seaweeds	1
among	1
which	1
it	1
lives.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
cases,	1
e.g.	1
among	1
spiders,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
animals	1
with	1
a	1
special	1
protective	1
resemblance	1
to	1
something	1
else	1
seek	1
out	1
a	1
position	1
where	1
this	1
resemblance	1
tells,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
urgent	1
need	1
for	1
observations	1
bearing	1
on	1
this	1
selection	1
of	1
environment.	1
§	1
5	1
Mimicry	1
in	1
the	1
True	1
Sense	1
It	1
sometimes	1
happens	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
groups	1
of	1
animals	1
not	1
very	1
nearly	1
related	1
which	1
are	1
"doubles"	1
of	1
one	1
another.	1
Investigation	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
group,	1
_always	1
in	1
the	1
majority_,	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
specially	1
protected,	1
e.g.	1
by	1
being	1
unpalatable.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
"mimicked."	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
group,	1
_always	1
in	1
the	1
minority_,	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
the	1
special	1
protection	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
others.	1
They	1
are	1
the	1
"mimickers,"	1
though	1
the	1
resemblance	1
is	1
not,	1
of	1
course,	1
associated	1
with	1
any	1
conscious	1
imitation.	1
The	1
theory	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
mimickers	1
live	1
on	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
the	1
mimicked.	1
If	1
the	1
mimicked	1
are	1
left	1
alone	1
by	1
birds	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
reputation	1
for	1
unpalatability,	1
or	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
sting,	1
the	1
mimickers	1
survive--although	1
they	1
are	1
palatable	1
and	1
stingless.	1
They	1
succeed,	1
not	1
through	1
any	1
virtue	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
mimicked,	1
for	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
mistaken.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
cases	1
of	1
mimetic	1
resemblance	1
so	1
striking	1
and	1
so	1
subtle	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
impossible	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
thing	1
works;	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
cases	1
which	1
are	1
rather	1
far-fetched,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
somewhat	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
coincidences.	1
Thus	1
although	1
Mr.	1
Bates	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
he	1
repeatedly	1
shot	1
humming-bird	1
moths	1
in	1
mistake	1
for	1
humming-birds,	1
we	1
cannot	1
think	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
illustration	1
of	1
mimicry.	1
What	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
many	1
cases	1
is	1
what	1
is	1
forthcoming	1
for	1
some,	1
namely,	1
experimental	1
evidence,	1
e.g.	1
that	1
the	1
unpalatable	1
mimicked	1
butterflies	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
relative	1
peace	1
while	1
similar	1
palatable	1
butterflies	1
are	1
persecuted.	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
necessary	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
mimickers	1
do	1
actually	1
consort	1
with	1
the	1
mimicked.	1
Some	1
beetles	1
and	1
moths	1
are	1
curiously	1
wasplike,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
advantage;	1
the	1
common	1
drone-fly	1
is	1
superficially	1
like	1
a	1
small	1
bee;	1
some	1
harmless	1
snakes	1
are	1
very	1
like	1
poisonous	1
species;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wallace	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
powerful	1
"friar-birds"	1
of	1
the	1
Far	1
East	1
are	1
mimicked	1
by	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
timid	1
orioles.	1
When	1
the	1
model	1
is	1
unpalatable	1
or	1
repulsive	1
or	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
the	1
mimic	1
the	1
reverse,	1
the	1
mimicry	1
is	1
called	1
"Batesian"	1
(after	1
Mr.	1
Bates),	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
kind	1
of	1
mimicry	1
called	1
Müan	1
(after	1
Fritz	1
Mü	1
where	1
the	1
mimic	1
is	1
also	1
unpalatable.	1
The	1
theory	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
mimicry	1
serves	1
as	1
mutual	1
assurance,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
ring	1
getting	1
on	1
better	1
by	1
consistently	1
presenting	1
the	1
same	1
appearance,	1
which	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
mean	1
to	1
possible	1
enemies	1
a	1
signal,	1
_Noli	1
me	1
tangere_	1
("Leave	1
me	1
alone").	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
this	1
theory,	1
but	1
it	1
requires	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
a	1
critical	1
spirit.	1
It	1
leads	1
us	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
"warning	1
colours,"	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
opposite	1
of	1
the	1
disguises	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
studying.	1
Some	1
creatures	1
like	1
skunks,	1
magpies,	1
coral-snakes,	1
cobras,	1
brightly	1
coloured	1
tree-frogs	1
are	1
obtrusive	1
rather	1
than	1
elusive,	1
and	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
Alfred	1
Russel	1
Wallace	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
flaunting	1
conspicuousness	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
useful	1
advertisement,	1
impressing	1
itself	1
on	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
inexperienced	1
enemies,	1
who	1
soon	1
learn	1
to	1
leave	1
creatures	1
with	1
"warning	1
colours"	1
alone.	1
In	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
an	1
animal	1
which	1
is	1
as	1
safe	1
as	1
a	1
wasp	1
or	1
a	1
coral-snake	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
wear	1
any	1
suit	1
of	1
clothes	1
it	1
likes.	1

Masking	1
The	1
episode	1
in	1
Scottish	1
history	1
called	1
"The	1
Walking	1
Wood	1
of	1
Birnam,"	1
when	1
the	1
advancing	1
troop	1
masked	1
their	1
approach	1
by	1
cutting	1
down	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
trees,	1
has	1
had	1
its	1
counterpart	1
in	1
many	1
countries.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
enacted	1
on	1
the	1
seashore.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
kinds	1
of	1
crabs	1
that	1
put	1
on	1
disguise	1
with	1
what	1
looks	1
like	1
deliberateness.	1
The	1
sand-crab	1
takes	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
seaweed,	1
nibbles	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
rubs	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
carapace	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
legs	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
fixes	1
to	1
the	1
bristles.	1
As	1
the	1
seaweed	1
continues	1
to	1
live,	1
the	1
crab	1
soon	1
has	1
a	1
little	1
garden	1
on	1
its	1
back	1
which	1
masks	1
the	1
crab's	1
real	1
nature.	1
It	1
is	1
most	1
effective	1
camouflaging,	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
crab	1
continues	1
to	1
grow	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
moult,	1
and	1
that	1
means	1
losing	1
the	1
disguise.	1
It	1
is	1
then	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
one.	1
The	1
crab	1
must	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
something	1
corresponding	1
to	1
a	1
reputation;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
other	1
animals	1
are	1
clearly	1
or	1
dimly	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
crab	1
is	1
a	1
voracious	1
and	1
combative	1
creature.	1
How	1
useful	1
to	1
the	1
crab,	1
then,	1
to	1
have	1
its	1
appearance	1
cloaked	1
by	1
a	1
growth	1
of	1
innocent	1
seaweed,	1
or	1
sponge,	1
or	1
zoophyte.	1
It	1
will	1
enable	1
the	1
creature	1
to	1
sneak	1
upon	1
its	1
victims	1
or	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
enemies.	1
If	1
a	1
narrow-beaked	1
crab	1
is	1
cleaned	1
artificially	1
it	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
clothe	1
itself	1
again,	1
the	1
habit	1
has	1
become	1
instinctive;	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
while	1
a	1
particular	1
crab	1
prefers	1
a	1
particular	1
kind	1
of	1
seaweed	1
for	1
its	1
dress,	1
it	1
will	1
cover	1
itself	1
with	1
unsuitable	1
and	1
even	1
conspicuous	1
material,	1
such	1
as	1
pieces	1
of	1
coloured	1
cloth,	1
if	1
nothing	1
better	1
is	1
available.	1
The	1
disguise	1
differs	1
greatly,	1
for	1
one	1
crab	1
is	1
masked	1
by	1
a	1
brightly	1
coloured	1
and	1
unpalatable	1
sponge	1
densely	1
packed	1
with	1
flinty	1
needles;	1
another	1
cuts	1
off	1
the	1
tunic	1
of	1
a	1
sea-squirt	1
and	1
throws	1
it	1
over	1
its	1
shoulders;	1
another	1
trundles	1
about	1
a	1
bivalve	1
shell.	1
The	1
facts	1
recall	1
the	1
familiar	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
hermit-crab,	1
which	1
protects	1
its	1
soft	1
tail	1
by	1
tucking	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
empty	1
shell	1
of	1
a	1
periwinkle	1
or	1
a	1
whelk	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
sea-snail,	1
and	1
that	1
case	1
leads	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
elaboration	1
known	1
as	1
commensalism,	1
where	1
the	1
hermit-crab	1
fixes	1
sea-anemones	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
its	1
borrowed	1
house.	1
The	1
advantage	1
here	1
is	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
masking,	1
for	1
the	1
sea-anemone	1
can	1
sting,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
useful	1
quality	1
in	1
a	1
partner.	1
That	1
this	1
second	1
advantage	1
may	1
become	1
the	1
main	1
one	1
is	1
evident	1
in	1
several	1
cases	1
where	1
the	1
sea-anemone	1
is	1
borne,	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
weapon,	1
on	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
crustacean's	1
great	1
claws.	1
Moreover,	1
as	1
the	1
term	1
commensalism	1
(eating	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
table)	1
suggests,	1
the	1
partnership	1
is	1
_mutually_	1
beneficial.	1
For	1
the	1
sea-anemone	1
is	1
carried	1
about	1
by	1
the	1
hermit-crab,	1
and	1
it	1
doubtless	1
gets	1
its	1
share	1
of	1
crumbs	1
from	1
its	1
partner's	1
frequent	1
meals.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
sidelight	1
on	1
the	1
mutual	1
benefit	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
dislodged	1
sea-anemone	1
which	1
sulked	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
and	1
then	1
waited	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
preparedness	1
until	1
a	1
hermit-crab	1
passed	1
by	1
and	1
touched	1
it.	1
Whereupon	1
the	1
sea-anemone	1
gripped	1
and	1
slowly	1
worked	1
itself	1
up	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
shell.	1
§	1
6	1
Other	1
Kinds	1
of	1
Elusiveness	1
There	1
are	1
various	1
kinds	1
of	1
disguise	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
readily	1
classified.	1
A	1
troop	1
of	1
cuttlefish	1
swimming	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
a	1
beautiful	1
sight.	1
They	1
keep	1
time	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
their	1
movements	1
and	1
they	1
show	1
the	1
same	1
change	1
of	1
colour	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment.	1
They	1
are	1
suddenly	1
attacked,	1
however,	1
by	1
a	1
small	1
shark,	1
and	1
then	1
comes	1
a	1
simultaneous	1
discharge	1
of	1
sepia	1
from	1
their	1
ink-bags.	1
There	1
are	1
clouds	1
of	1
ink	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
water,	1
for,	1
as	1
Professor	1
Hickson	1
puts	1
it,	1
the	1
cuttlefishes	1
have	1
thrown	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
their	1
enemies.	1
One	1
can	1
see	1
a	1
newborn	1
cuttlefish	1
do	1
this	1
a	1
minute	1
after	1
it	1
escapes	1
from	1
the	1
egg.	1
Very	1
beautiful	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
many	1
birds,	1
like	1
our	1
common	1
chaffinch,	1
disguise	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
their	1
nest	1
with	1
moss	1
and	1
lichen	1
and	1
other	1
trifles	1
felted	1
together,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
cradle	1
is	1
as	1
inconspicuous	1
as	1
possible.	1
There	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
art	1
in	1
fastening	1
pieces	1
of	1
spider's	1
web	1
on	1
the	1
outside	1
of	1
a	1
nest!	1
How	1
curious	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
tree-sloth	1
of	1
South	1
American	1
forests,	1
that	1
walks	1
slowly,	1
back	1
downwards,	1
along	1
the	1
undersides	1
of	1
the	1
branches,	1
hanging	1
on	1
by	1
its	1
long,	1
curved	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
nocturnal	1
animal,	1
and	1
therefore	1
not	1
in	1
special	1
danger,	1
but	1
when	1
resting	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
invisible	1
because	1
its	1
shaggy	1
hair	1
is	1
so	1
like	1
certain	1
lichens	1
and	1
other	1
growths	1
on	1
the	1
branches.	1
But	1
the	1
protective	1
resemblance	1
is	1
enhanced	1
by	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
alga,	1
which	1
actually	1
lives	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sloth's	1
hairs--an	1
alga	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
makes	1
tree-stems	1
and	1
gate-posts	1
green	1
in	1
damp	1
weather.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
commoner	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
summer	1
than	1
the	1
cuckoo-spit	1
on	1
the	1
grasses	1
and	1
herbage	1
by	1
the	1
wayside.	1
It	1
is	1
conspicuous	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
severely	1
alone	1
by	1
almost	1
all	1
creatures.	1
In	1
some	1
way	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
disguise.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
soap	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
small	1
frog-hoppers	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
wingless	1
larval	1
stage,	1
before	1
they	1
begin	1
to	1
hop.	1
The	1
insect	1
pierces	1
with	1
its	1
sharp	1
mouth-parts	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
plant	1
and	1
sucks	1
in	1
sweet	1
sap	1
which	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
overflows	1
over	1
its	1
body.	1
It	1
works	1
its	1
body	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
many	1
times,	1
whipping	1
in	1
air,	1
which	1
mixes	1
with	1
the	1
sugary	1
sap,	1
reminding	1
one	1
of	1
how	1
"whipped	1
egg"	1
is	1
made.	1
But	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
sugary	1
sap	1
and	1
the	1
air,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
ferment	1
from	1
the	1
food-canal	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
wax	1
from	1
glands	1
on	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
things	1
mixed	1
together	1
make	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
soap	1
which	1
lasts	1
through	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
There	1
are	1
many	1
other	1
modes	1
of	1
disguise	1
besides	1
those	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
illustrate.	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
biggest	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many,	1
for	1
it	1
brings	1
us	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
easy	1
business.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
as	1
Walt	1
Whitman	1
says,	1
that	1
animals	1
do	1
not	1
sweat	1
and	1
whine	1
about	1
their	1
condition;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
as	1
he	1
says,	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
is	1
unhappy	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
truth,	1
that	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
unlit	1
lamp	1
and	1
the	1
ungirt	1
loin,	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
creature	1
has	1
not	1
armour	1
or	1
weapons	1
or	1
cleverness	1
it	1
must	1
find	1
some	1
path	1
of	1
safety	1
or	1
go	1
back.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
paths	1
of	1
safety	1
is	1
disguise,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
illustrated	1
its	1
evolution.	1
V	1
THE	1
ASCENT	1
OF	1
MAN	1
THE	1
ASCENT	1
OF	1
MAN	1
§	1
1	1
No	1
one	1
thinks	1
less	1
of	1
Sir	1
Isaac	1
Newton	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
puny	1
infant,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
think	1
less	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
because	1
it	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1
arboreal	1
mammals.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
man's	1
apartness	1
from	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
creation	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
seen	1
at	1
his	1
best--"a	1
little	1
lower	1
than	1
the	1
angels,	1
crowned	1
with	1
glory	1
and	1
honour."	1
"What	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
is	1
a	1
man!	1
How	1
noble	1
in	1
reason!	1
How	1
infinite	1
in	1
faculty!	1
in	1
form	1
and	1
moving	1
how	1
express	1
and	1
admirable!	1
in	1
action	1
how	1
like	1
an	1
angel!	1
in	1
apprehension	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
God."	1
Nevertheless,	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
point	1
to	1
his	1
affiliation	1
to	1
the	1
stock	1
to	1
which	1
monkeys	1
and	1
apes	1
also	1
belong.	1
Not,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
descended	1
from	1
any	1
living	1
ape	1
or	1
monkey;	1
it	1
is	1
rather	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
sprung	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
ancestry--are	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
stem.	1
This	1
conclusion	1
is	1
so	1
momentous	1
that	1
the	1
reasons	1
for	1
accepting	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
carefully	1
considered.	1
They	1
were	1
expounded	1
with	1
masterly	1
skill	1
in	1
Darwin's	1
_Descent	1
of	1
Man_	1
in	1
1871--a	1
book	1
which	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
expansion	1
of	1
a	1
chapter	1
in	1
_The	1
Origin	1
of	1
Species_	1
(1859).	1
Anatomical	1
Proof	1
of	1
Man's	1
Relationship	1
with	1
a	1
Simian	1
Stock	1
The	1
anatomical	1
structure	1
of	1
man	1
is	1
closely	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
apes--the	1
gorilla,	1
the	1
orang,	1
the	1
chimpanzee,	1
and	1
the	1
gibbon.	1
Bone	1
for	1
bone,	1
muscle	1
for	1
muscle,	1
blood-vessel	1
for	1
blood-vessel,	1
nerve	1
for	1
nerve,	1
man	1
and	1
ape	1
agree.	1
As	1
the	1
conservative	1
anatomist,	1
Sir	1
Richard	1
Owen,	1
said,	1
there	1
is	1
between	1
them	1
"an	1
all-pervading	1
similitude	1
of	1
structure."	1
Differences,	1
of	1
course,	1
there	1
are,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
momentous	1
except	1
man's	1
big	1
brain,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
heavy	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
gorilla.	1
The	1
average	1
human	1
brain	1
weighs	1
about	1
48	1
ounces;	1
the	1
gorilla	1
brain	1
does	1
not	1
exceed	1
20	1
ounces	1
at	1
its	1
best.	1
The	1
capacity	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
skull	1
is	1
never	1
less	1
than	1
55	1
cubic	1
inches;	1
in	1
the	1
orang	1
and	1
the	1
chimpanzee	1
the	1
figures	1
are	1
26	1
and	1
27-1/2	1
respectively.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
suggesting	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
distinctive	1
features	1
of	1
man	1
are	1
such	1
as	1
can	1
be	1
measured	1
and	1
weighed,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
the	1
main	1
seat	1
of	1
his	1
mental	1
powers	1
is	1
physically	1
far	1
ahead	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
apes.	1
Man	1
alone	1
is	1
thoroughly	1
erect	1
after	1
his	1
infancy	1
is	1
past;	1
his	1
head	1
weighted	1
with	1
the	1
heavy	1
brain	1
does	1
not	1
droop	1
forward	1
as	1
the	1
ape's	1
does;	1
with	1
his	1
erect	1
attitude	1
there	1
is	1
perhaps	1
to	1
be	1
associated	1
his	1
more	1
highly	1
developed	1
vocal	1
organs.	1
Compared	1
with	1
an	1
anthropoid	1
ape,	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
bigger	1
and	1
more	1
upright	1
forehead,	1
a	1
less	1
protrusive	1
face	1
region,	1
smaller	1
cheek-bones	1
and	1
eyebrow	1
ridges,	1
and	1
more	1
uniform	1
teeth.	1
He	1
is	1
almost	1
unique	1
in	1
having	1
a	1
chin.	1
Man	1
plants	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
flat	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
his	1
big	1
toe	1
is	1
usually	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
toes,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
better	1
heel	1
than	1
any	1
monkey	1
has.	1
The	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
enlargement	1
of	1
the	1
brain,	1
and	1
also	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
natural	1
reduction	1
of	1
the	1
muzzle	1
region	1
when	1
the	1
hand	1
was	1
freed	1
from	1
being	1
an	1
organ	1
of	1
support	1
and	1
became	1
suited	1
for	1
grasping	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
conveying	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mouth.	1
Everyone	1
is	1
familiar	1
in	1
man's	1
clothing	1
with	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
persisting	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
though	1
their	1
use	1
has	1
long	1
since	1
disappeared.	1
There	1
are	1
buttons	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
waist	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
coat	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
tails	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
fastened	1
up,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
buttons,	1
occasionally	1
with	1
buttonholes,	1
at	1
the	1
wrist	1
which	1
were	1
once	1
useful	1
in	1
turning	1
up	1
the	1
sleeve.	1
The	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
man's	1
body,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
veritable	1
museum	1
of	1
relics.	1
Some	1
anatomists	1
have	1
made	1
out	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
over	1
a	1
hundred	1
of	1
these	1
_vestigial_	1
structures,	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
number	1
is	1
perhaps	1
too	1
high,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
list	1
is	1
long.	1
In	1
the	1
inner	1
upper	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
eye	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
minute	1
tag--but	1
larger	1
in	1
some	1
races	1
than	1
in	1
others--which	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
dwindling	1
relic	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
eyelid,	1
used	1
in	1
cleaning	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
which	1
most	1
mammals	1
possess	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
well-developed	1
form.	1
It	1
can	1
be	1
easily	1
seen,	1
for	1
instance,	1
in	1
ox	1
and	1
rabbit.	1
In	1
man	1
and	1
in	1
monkeys	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
useless	1
vestige,	1
and	1
the	1
dwindling	1
must	1
be	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
upper	1
eyelid	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
mobile	1
in	1
man	1
and	1
monkeys	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
mammals.	1
The	1
vestigial	1
third	1
eyelid	1
in	1
man	1
is	1
enough	1
of	1
itself	1
to	1
prove	1
his	1
relationship	1
with	1
the	1
mammals,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
one	1
example	1
out	1
of	1
many.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
are	1
discussed	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
human	1
body,	1
but	1
we	1
may	1
mention	1
the	1
vestigial	1
muscles	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
ear-trumpet,	1
man's	1
dwindling	1
counterpart	1
of	1
the	1
skin-twitching	1
muscle	1
which	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
horse	1
use	1
when	1
he	1
jerks	1
a	1
fly	1
off	1
his	1
flanks,	1
and	1
the	1
short	1
tail	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
seven-weeks-old	1
human	1
embryo	1
is	1
actually	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
leg.	1
Without	1
committing	1
ourselves	1
to	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
the	1
entire	1
uselessness	1
of	1
the	1
vermiform	1
appendix,	1
which	1
grows	1
out	1
as	1
a	1
blind	1
alley	1
at	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
intestine	1
with	1
the	1
large,	1
we	1
are	1
safe	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
dwindling	1
structure--the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
blind	1
gut	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
capacious	1
and	1
useful	1
in	1
ancestral	1
forms.	1
In	1
some	1
mammals,	1
like	1
the	1
rabbit,	1
the	1
blind	1
gut	1
is	1
the	1
bulkiest	1
structure	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
bears	1
the	1
vermiform	1
appendix	1
at	1
its	1
far	1
end.	1
In	1
man	1
the	1
appendix	1
alone	1
is	1
left,	1
and	1
it	1
tells	1
its	1
tale.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
usually	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
orang	1
than	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
variable,	1
as	1
dwindling	1
structures	1
tend	1
to	1
be.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
expressions	1
of	1
this	1
variability	1
is	1
the	1
liability	1
to	1
go	1
wrong:	1
hence	1
appendicitis.	1
Now	1
these	1
vestigial	1
structures	1
are,	1
as	1
Darwin	1
said,	1
like	1
the	1
unsounded,	1
i.e.	1
functionless,	1
letters	1
in	1
words,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
_o_	1
in	1
"leopard,"	1
the	1
_b_	1
in	1
"doubt,"	1
the	1
_g_	1
in	1
"reign."	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
no	1
use,	1
but	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
words.	1
So	1
do	1
man's	1
vestigial	1
structures	1
reveal	1
his	1
pedigree.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
an	1
historical	1
or	1
evolutionary	1
significance.	1
No	1
other	1
interpretation	1
is	1
possible.	1

Physiological	1
Proof	1

Man's	1
Relationship	1
with	1
a	1
Simian	1
Stock	1
The	1
everyday	1
functions	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
body	1
are	1
practically	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
ape,	1
and	1
similar	1
disorders	1
are	1
common	1
to	1
both.	1
Monkeys	1
may	1
be	1
infected	1
with	1
certain	1
microbes	1
to	1
which	1
man	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
liable,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
bacillus	1
of	1
tuberculosis.	1
Darwin	1
showed	1
that	1
various	1
human	1
gestures	1
and	1
facial	1
expressions	1
have	1
their	1
counterparts	1
in	1
monkeys.	1
The	1
sneering	1
curl	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
lip,	1
which	1
tends	1
to	1
expose	1
the	1
canine	1
tooth,	1
is	1
a	1
case	1
in	1
point,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
mammals	1
besides	1
monkeys--in	1
dogs,	1
for	1
instance,	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
some	1
considerable	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
simian	1
branch	1
to	1
which	1
man's	1
ancestors	1
belonged.	1
When	1
human	1
blood	1
is	1
transfused	1
into	1
a	1
dog	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
monkey,	1
it	1
behaves	1
in	1
a	1
hostile	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
blood,	1
bringing	1
about	1
a	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
red	1
blood	1
corpuscles.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
transfused	1
into	1
a	1
chimpanzee	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
harmonious	1
mingling	1
of	1
the	1
two.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
literal	1
demonstration	1
of	1
man's	1
blood-relationship	1
with	1
the	1
higher	1
apes.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
finer	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
experiment.	1
When	1
the	1
blood-fluid	1
(or	1
serum)	1
of	1
a	1
rabbit,	1
which	1
has	1
had	1
human	1
blood	1
injected	1
into	1
it,	1
is	1
mingled	1
with	1
human	1
blood,	1
it	1
forms	1
a	1
cloudy	1
precipitate.	1
It	1
forms	1
almost	1
as	1
marked	1
a	1
precipitate	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
an	1
anthropoid	1
ape.	1
But	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
an	1
American	1
monkey	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
slight	1
clouding	1
after	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
and	1
no	1
actual	1
precipitate.	1
When	1
it	1
is	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
distantly	1
related	1
"half-monkeys"	1
or	1
lemurs	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reaction	1
or	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
weak	1
one.	1
With	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
mammals	1
off	1
the	1
simian	1
line	1
altogether	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reaction	1
at	1
all.	1
Thus,	1
as	1
a	1
distinguished	1
anthropologist,	1
Professor	1
Schwalbe,	1
has	1
said:	1
"We	1
have	1
in	1
this	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
literal	1
blood-relationship	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
apes,	1
but	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
relationship	1
with	1
the	1
different	1
main	1
groups	1
of	1
apes	1
can	1
be	1
determined	1
beyond	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistake."	1
We	1
can	1
imagine	1
how	1
this	1
modern	1
line	1
of	1
experiment	1
would	1
have	1
delighted	1
Darwin.	1

Man's	1
Relationship	1
with	1

Simian	1
Stock	1
In	1
his	1
individual	1
development,	1
man	1
does	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
climb	1
up	1
his	1
own	1
genealogical	1
tree.	1
Stages	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
during	1
its	1
nine	1
months	1
of	1
ante-natal	1
life	1
are	1
closely	1
similar	1
to	1
stages	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
embryo.	1
Babies	1
born	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
famine	1
or	1
siege	1
are	1
sometimes,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
imperfectly	1
finished,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
have	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
described	1
as	1
monkeyish	1
features	1
and	1
ways.	1
A	1
visit	1
to	1
an	1
institution	1
for	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
children	1
who	1
show	1
arrested,	1
defective,	1
or	1
disturbed	1
development	1
leaves	1
one	1
sadly	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
slipping	1
down	1
the	1
rungs	1
of	1
the	1
steep	1
ladder	1
of	1
evolution;	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
adults	1
the	1
occurrence	1
of	1
serious	1
nervous	1
disturbance,	1
such	1
as	1
"shell-shock,"	1
is	1
sometimes	1
marked	1
by	1
relapses	1
to	1
animal	1
ways.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
familiar	1
fact	1
that	1
a	1
normal	1
baby	1
reveals	1
the	1
past	1
in	1
its	1
surprising	1
power	1
of	1
grip,	1
and	1
the	1
careful	1
experiments	1
of	1
Dr.	1
Louis	1
Robinson	1
showed	1
that	1
an	1
infant	1
three	1
weeks	1
old	1
could	1
support	1
its	1
own	1
weight	1
for	1
over	1
two	1
minutes,	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
horizontal	1
bar.	1
"In	1
many	1
cases	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
distress	1
is	1
evinced	1
and	1
no	1
cry	1
uttered,	1
until	1
the	1
grasp	1
begins	1
to	1
give	1
way."	1
This	1
persistent	1
grasp	1
probably	1
points	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
baby	1
had	1
to	1
cling	1
to	1
its	1
arboreal	1
mother.	1
The	1
human	1
tail	1
is	1
represented	1
in	1
the	1
adult	1
by	1
a	1
fusion	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
vertebræorming	1
the	1
"coccyx"	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
backbone,	1
and	1
is	1
normally	1
concealed	1
beneath	1
the	1
flesh,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
embryo	1
the	1
tail	1
projects	1
freely	1
and	1
is	1
movable.	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
sixth	1
month	1
of	1
the	1
ante-natal	1
sleep	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
covered,	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
palms	1
and	1
soles,	1
with	1
longish	1
hair	1
(the	1
lanugo),	1
which	1
usually	1
disappears	1
before	1
birth.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
normal	1
development,	1
which	1
is	1
reasonably	1
interpreted	1
as	1
a	1
recapitulation	1
of	1
a	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
racial	1
evolution.	1
We	1
draw	1
this	1
inference	1
when	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
unborn	1
offspring	1
of	1
an	1
almost	1
hairless	1
whale	1
has	1
an	1
abundant	1
representation	1
of	1
hairs;	1
we	1
must	1
draw	1
a	1
similar	1
inference	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
man.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
noticed	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
serious	1
errors	1
in	1
the	1
careless	1
statement	1
often	1
made	1
that	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
development	1
is	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
fish,	1
at	1
a	1
later	1
stage	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
reptile,	1
at	1
a	1
later	1
stage	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
primitive	1
mammal,	1
and	1
eventually	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
monkey.	1
The	1
first	1
error	1
here	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
comparison	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
_embryo_-fish,	1
_embryo_-reptile,	1
_embryo_-mammal,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
the	1
embryos	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
resemblance	1
lies.	1
When	1
the	1
human	1
embryo	1
shows	1
the	1
laying	1
down	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
vertebrate	1
characters,	1
such	1
as	1
brain	1
and	1
spinal	1
cord,	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
closely	1
comparable	1
to	1
the	1
embryo	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
vertebrate	1
at	1
a	1
similar	1
stage.	1
When,	1
at	1
a	1
subsequent	1
stage,	1
its	1
heart,	1
for	1
instance,	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
four-chambered	1
mammalian	1
heart,	1
it	1
is	1
closely	1
comparable	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of,	1
let	1
us	1
say,	1
a	1
turtle,	1
which	1
never	1
becomes	1
more	1
than	1
three-chambered.	1
The	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
the	1
organs	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
say	1
brain	1
and	1
kidneys,	1
the	1
embryo	1
of	1
man	1
pursues	1
a	1
path	1
closely	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
path	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
embryos	1
of	1
other	1
backboned	1
animals	1
lower	1
in	1
the	1
scale,	1
but	1
at	1
successive	1
stages	1
it	1
parts	1
company	1
with	1
these,	1
with	1
the	1
lowest	1
first	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
in	1
succession.	1
A	1
human	1
embryo	1
is	1
never	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
reptile,	1
but	1
the	1
developing	1
organs	1
pass	1
through	1
stages	1
which	1
very	1
closely	1
resemble	1
the	1
corresponding	1
stages	1
in	1
lower	1
types	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
general	1
way	1
ancestral.	1
The	1
second	1
error	1
is	1
that	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
animal,	1
man	1
included,	1
has	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
a	1
certain	1
individuality,	1
with	1
peculiar	1
characteristics	1
which	1
are	1
all	1
its	1
own.	1
This	1
is	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
somewhat	1
difficult	1
word	1
_specificity_,	1
which	1
just	1
means	1
that	1
every	1
species	1
is	1
itself	1
and	1
no	1
other.	1
So	1
in	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
embryo,	1
while	1
there	1
are	1
close	1
resemblances	1
to	1
the	1
embryos	1
of	1
apes,	1
monkeys,	1
other	1
mammals,	1
and	1
even,	1
at	1
earlier	1
stages	1
still,	1
to	1
the	1
embryos	1
of	1
reptile	1
and	1
fish,	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
dealing	1
from	1
first	1
to	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
human	1
embryo	1
with	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1

Every	1
human	1
being	1
begins	1
his	1
or	1
her	1
life	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
cell--a	1
fertilised	1
egg-cell,	1
a	1
treasure-house	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
ages.	1
For	1
in	1
this	1
living	1
microcosm,	1
only	1
a	1
small	1
fraction	1
(1/125)	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
diameter,	1
there	1
is	1
condensed--who	1
can	1
imagine	1
how?--all	1
the	1
natural	1
inheritance	1
of	1
man,	1
all	1
the	1
legacy	1
of	1
his	1
parentage,	1
of	1
his	1
ancestry,	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
pre-human	1
pedigree.	1
Darwin	1
called	1
the	1
pinhead	1
brain	1
of	1
the	1
ant	1
the	1
most	1
marvellous	1
atom	1
of	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
the	1
human	1
ovum	1
is	1
more	1
marvellous	1
still.	1
It	1
has	1
more	1
possibilities	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
thing,	1
yet	1
without	1
fertilisation	1
it	1
will	1
die.	1
The	1
fertilised	1
ovum	1
divides	1
and	1
redivides;	1
there	1
results	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
cells	1
and	1
a	1
sack	1
of	1
cells;	1
gradually	1
division	1
of	1
labour	1
becomes	1
the	1
rule;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
laying	1
down	1
of	1
nervous	1
system	1
and	1
food-canal,	1
muscular	1
system	1
and	1
skeleton,	1
and	1
so	1
proceeds	1
what	1
is	1
learnedly	1
called	1
differentiation.	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
apparently	1
simple	1
there	1
emerges	1
the	1
obviously	1
complex.	1
As	1
Aristotle	1
observed	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago,	1
in	1
the	1
developing	1
egg	1
of	1
the	1
hen	1
there	1
soon	1
appears	1
the	1
beating	1
heart!	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
non-living	1
world.	1
But	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
developing	1
human	1
embryo,	1
there	1
is	1
formed	1
from	1
and	1
above	1
the	1
embryonic	1
food-canal	1
a	1
skeletal	1
rod,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
notochord.	1
It	1
thrills	1
the	1
imagination	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
supporting	1
axis	1
that	1
the	1
lower	1
orders	1
of	1
the	1
backboned	1
race	1
possess.	1
The	1
curious	1
thing	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
become	1
the	1
backbone,	1
which	1
is	1
certainly	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
vertebrate	1
race.	1
The	1
notochord	1
is	1
the	1
supporting	1
axis	1
of	1
the	1
pioneer	1
backboned	1
animals,	1
namely	1
the	1
Lancelets	1
and	1
the	1
Round-mouths	1
(Cyclostomes),	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
Lamprey.	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
backbone	1
in	1
the	1
strict	1
sense,	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
this	1
notochord.	1
It	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
dissected	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
lamprey--a	1
long	1
gristly	1
rod.	1
It	1
is	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
sheath	1
which	1
becomes	1
the	1
backbone	1
of	1
most	1
fishes	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
higher	1
animals.	1
The	1
interesting	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
although	1
the	1
notochord	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
vestige	1
in	1
the	1
adults	1
of	1
these	1
types,	1
it	1
is	1
never	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
embryo.	1
It	1
occurs	1
even	1
in	1
man,	1
a	1
short-lived	1
relic	1
of	1
the	1
primeval	1
supporting	1
axis	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
It	1
comes	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
goes,	1
leaving	1
only	1
minute	1
traces	1
in	1
the	1
adult.	1
We	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
any	1
use,	1
unless	1
it	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
stimulus	1
to	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
its	1
substitute,	1
the	1
backbone.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
preliminary	1
scaffolding,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
eloquent	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
One	1
other	1
instance	1
must	1
suffice	1
of	1
what	1
Professor	1
Lull	1
calls	1
the	1
wonderful	1
changes	1
wrought	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
of	1
the	1
ante-natal	1
period,	1
which	1
recapitulate	1
in	1
rapid	1
abbreviation	1
the	1
great	1
evolutionary	1
steps	1
which	1
were	1
taken	1
by	1
man's	1
ancestors	1
"during	1
the	1
long	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
geological	1
past."	1
On	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
embryo	1
there	1
are	1
four	1
pairs	1
of	1
slits,	1
the	1
"visceral	1
clefts,"	1
openings	1
from	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
food-canals	1
to	1
the	1
surface.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
significance.	1
They	1
correspond	1
to	1
the	1
gill-slits	1
of	1
fishes	1
and	1
tadpoles.	1
Yet	1
in	1
reptiles,	1
birds,	1
and	1
mammals	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
breathing,	1
which	1
is	1
their	1
function	1
in	1
fishes	1
and	1
amphibians.	1
Indeed,	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
at	1
all,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
becomes	1
the	1
Eustachian	1
tube	1
bringing	1
the	1
ear-passage	1
into	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
second	1
and	1
third	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
a	1
curious	1
organ	1
called	1
the	1
thymus	1
gland.	1
Persistent,	1
nevertheless,	1
these	1
gill-slits	1
are,	1
recalling	1
even	1
in	1
man	1
an	1
aquatic	1
ancestry	1
of	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
ago.	1
When	1
all	1
these	1
lines	1
of	1
evidence	1
are	1
considered,	1
they	1
are	1
seen	1
to	1
converge	1
in	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
a	1
simian	1
stock	1
of	1
mammals.	1
He	1
is	1
solidary	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
creation.	1
To	1
quote	1
the	1
closing	1
words	1
of	1
Darwin's	1
_Descent	1
of	1
Man_:	1
We	1
must,	1
however,	1
acknowledge,	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
man	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
noble	1
qualities,	1
with	1
sympathy	1
which	1
feels	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
debased,	1
with	1
benevolence	1
which	1
extends	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
other	1
men	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
humblest	1
living	1
creature,	1
with	1
his	1
God-like	1
intellect,	1
which	1
has	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
movements	1
and	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
system--with	1
all	1
these	1
exalted	1
powers--man	1
still	1
bears	1
in	1
his	1
bodily	1
frame	1
the	1
indelible	1
stamp	1
of	1
his	1
lowly	1
origin.	1
We	1
should	1
be	1
clear	1
that	1
this	1
view	1
does	1
not	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
man	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
stock	1
common	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
higher	1
apes.	1
Those	1
who	1
are	1
repelled	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
man's	1
derivation	1
from	1
a	1
simian	1
type	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
theory	1
implies	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
this,	1
namely,	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
a	1
genealogy	1
which	1
has	1
implied	1
many	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
of	1
experimenting	1
and	1
sifting--the	1
groaning	1
and	1
travailing	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
creation.	1
Speaking	1
of	1
man's	1
mental	1
qualities,	1
Sir	1
Ray	1
Lankester	1
says:	1
"They	1
justify	1
the	1
view	1
that	1
man	1
forms	1
a	1
new	1
departure	1
in	1
the	1
gradual	1
unfolding	1
of	1
Nature's	1
predestined	1
plan."	1
In	1
any	1
case,	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
square	1
our	1
views	1
with	1
the	1
facts,	1
not	1
the	1
facts	1
with	1
our	1
views,	1
and	1
while	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
is	1
that	1
man	1
stands	1
unique	1
and	1
apart,	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
that	1
man	1
is	1
a	1
scion	1
of	1
a	1
progressive	1
simian	1
stock.	1
Naturalists	1
have	1
exposed	1
the	1
pit	1
whence	1
man	1
has	1
been	1
digged	1
and	1
the	1
rock	1
whence	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
hewn,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
surely	1
a	1
heartening	1
encouragement	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
ascent,	1
not	1
a	1
descent,	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
behind	1
us.	1
There	1
is	1
wisdom	1
in	1
Pascal's	1
maxim:	1
It	1
is	1
dangerous	1
to	1
show	1
man	1
too	1
plainly	1
how	1
like	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
animals,	1
without,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
reminding	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
greatness.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
unwise	1
to	1
impress	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
greatness	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
lowliness.	1
It	1
is	1
worse	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
in	1
ignorance	1
of	1
both.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
profitable	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
two	1
facts.	1
§	1
3	1
Man's	1
Pedigree	1
The	1
facts	1
of	1
anatomy,	1
physiology,	1
and	1
embryology,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
given	1
illustrations,	1
all	1
point	1
to	1
man's	1
affiliation	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
monkeys	1
and	1
apes.	1
To	1
this	1
order	1
is	1
given	1
the	1
name	1
Primates,	1
and	1
our	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
question	1
must	1
be	1
when	1
and	1
whence	1
the	1
Primates	1
began.	1
The	1
rock	1
record	1
answers	1
the	1
first	1
question:	1
the	1
Primates	1
emerged	1
about	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
the	1
Eocene	1
era,	1
when	1
grass	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
a	1
garment.	1
Their	1
ancestral	1
home	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
in	1
both	1
hemispheres,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
migrated	1
to	1
Africa,	1
India,	1
Malay,	1
and	1
South	1
America.	1
In	1
North	1
America	1
the	1
Primates	1
soon	1
became	1
extinct,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
later	1
on	1
in	1
Europe.	1
In	1
this	1
case,	1
however,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
repeopling	1
from	1
the	1
South	1
(in	1
the	1
Lower	1
Miocene)	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
second	1
extinction	1
(in	1
the	1
Upper	1
Pliocene)	1
before	1
man	1
appeared.	1
There	1
is	1
considerable	1
evidence	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
Professor	1
R.	1
S.	1
Lull's	1
conclusion,	1
that	1
in	1
Southern	1
Asia,	1
Africa,	1
and	1
South	1
America	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
Primates	1
was	1
continuous	1
since	1
the	1
first	1
great	1
southward	1
migration,	1
and	1
there	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
an	1
abundant	1
modern	1
representation	1
of	1
Primates	1
in	1
these	1
regions	1
to-day.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
question:	1
Whence	1
the	1
Primates	1
sprang,	1
the	1
answer	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
conjectural.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
reasonable	1
view	1
that	1
Carnivores	1
and	1
Primates	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
common	1
Insectivore	1
stock,	1
the	1
one	1
order	1
diverging	1
towards	1
flesh-eating	1
and	1
hunting	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
other	1
order	1
diverging	1
towards	1
fruit-eating	1
and	1
arboreal	1
habits.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
Insectivores	1
(including	1
shrews,	1
tree-shrews,	1
hedgehog,	1
mole,	1
and	1
the	1
like)	1
were	1
very	1
plastic	1
and	1
progressive	1
mammals.	1
What	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
ages	1
was	1
the	1
divergence	1
of	1
branch	1
after	1
branch	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
Primate	1
stem.	1
First	1
there	1
diverged	1
the	1
South	1

a	1
line	1
of	1
their	1

and	1
then	1
the	1
Old	1
World	1
monkeys,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
macaques	1
and	1
baboons.	1
Ages	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
main	1
stems	1
gave	1
off	1
(in	1
the	1
Oligocene	1
period)	1
the	1
branch	1
now	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
small	1
anthropoid	1
apes--the	1
gibbon	1
and	1
the	1
siamang.	1
Distinctly	1
later	1
there	1
diverged	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
anthropoid	1
apes--the	1
gorilla,	1
the	1
chimpanzee,	1
and	1
the	1
orang.	1
That	1
left	1
a	1
generalised	1
humanoid	1
stock	1
separated	1
off	1
from	1
all	1
monkeys	1
and	1
apes,	1
and	1
including	1
the	1
immediate	1
precursors	1
of	1
man.	1
When	1
this	1
sifting	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
generalised	1
humanoid	1
stock	1
took	1
place	1
remains	1
very	1
uncertain,	1
some	1
authorities	1
referring	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
Miocene,	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
early	1
Pliocene.	1
Some	1
would	1
estimate	1
its	1
date	1
at	1
half	1
a	1
million	1
years	1
ago,	1
others	1
at	1
two	1
millions!	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
questions	1
of	1
chronology	1
do	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
admit	1
of	1
scientific	1
statement.	1

We	1
are	1
on	1
firmer,	1
though	1
still	1
uncertain,	1
ground	1
when	1
we	1
state	1
the	1
probability	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Asia	1
that	1
the	1
precursors	1
of	1
man	1
were	1
separated	1
off	1
from	1
monkeys	1
and	1
apes,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
terrestrial	1
rather	1
than	1
arboreal.	1
Professor	1
Lull	1
points	1
out	1
that	1
Asia	1
is	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
oldest	1
known	1
human	1
remains	1
(in	1
Java),	1
and	1
that	1
Asia	1
was	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
civilisations	1
and	1
the	1
original	1
home	1
of	1
many	1
domesticated	1
animals	1
and	1
cultivated	1
plants.	1
The	1
probability	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
cradle	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
was	1
in	1
Asia.	1
Man's	1
Arboreal	1
Apprenticeship	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
useful	1
to	1
consider	1
man's	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
terrestrial	1
journeyman.	1
Professor	1
Wood	1
Jones	1
has	1
worked	1
out	1
very	1
convincingly	1
the	1
thesis	1
that	1
man	1
had	1
no	1
direct	1
four-footed	1
ancestry,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
Primate	1
stock	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
belongs	1
was	1
from	1
its	1
first	1
divergence	1
arboreal.	1
He	1
maintains	1
that	1
the	1
leading	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
precursors	1
of	1
man	1
were	1
wrought	1
out	1
during	1
a	1
long	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship.	1
The	1
first	1
great	1
gain	1
of	1
arboreal	1
life	1
on	1
bipedal	1
erect	1
lines	1
(not	1
after	1
the	1
quadrupedal	1
fashion	1
of	1
tree-sloths,	1
for	1
instance)	1
was	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
hand.	1
The	1
foot	1
became	1
the	1
supporting	1
and	1
branch-gripping	1
member,	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
was	1
set	1
free	1
to	1
reach	1
upward,	1
to	1
hang	1
on	1
by,	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
fruit,	1
to	1
lift	1
it	1
and	1
hold	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
to	1
hug	1
the	1
young	1
one	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
breast.	1
The	1
hand	1
thus	1
set	1
free	1
has	1
remained	1
plastic--a	1
generalised,	1
not	1
a	1
specialised	1
member.	1
Much	1
has	1
followed	1
from	1
man's	1
"handiness."	1
The	1
arboreal	1
life	1
had	1
many	1
other	1
consequences.	1
It	1
led	1
to	1
an	1
increased	1
freedom	1
of	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
thigh	1
on	1
the	1
hip	1
joint,	1
to	1
muscular	1
arrangements	1
for	1
balancing	1
the	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
leg,	1
to	1
making	1
the	1
backbone	1
a	1
supple	1
yet	1
stable	1
curved	1
pillar,	1
to	1
a	1
strongly	1
developed	1
collar-bone	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
found	1
well-formed	1
when	1
the	1
fore-limb	1
is	1
used	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
support,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
"opposing"	1
the	1
thumb	1
and	1
the	1
big	1
toe	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
digits	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
foot--an	1
obvious	1
advantage	1
for	1
branch-gripping.	1
But	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
hand	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
dispense	1
with	1
protrusive	1
lips	1
and	1
gripping	1
teeth.	1
Thus	1
began	1
the	1
recession	1
of	1
the	1
snout	1
region,	1
the	1
associated	1
enlargement	1
of	1
the	1
brain-box,	1
and	1
the	1
bringing	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
front.	1
The	1
overcrowding	1
of	1
the	1
teeth	1
that	1
followed	1
the	1
shortening	1
of	1
the	1
snout	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
taxes	1
on	1
progress	1
of	1
which	1
modern	1
man	1
is	1
often	1
reminded	1
in	1
his	1
dental	1
troubles.	1
Another	1
acquisition	1
associated	1
with	1
arboreal	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
greatly	1
increased	1
power	1
of	1
turning	1
the	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side--a	1
mobility	1
very	1
important	1
in	1
locating	1
sounds	1
and	1
in	1
exploring	1
with	1
the	1
eyes.	1
Furthermore,	1
there	1
came	1
about	1
a	1
flattening	1
of	1
the	1
chest	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
midriff	1
(or	1
diaphragm)	1
came	1
to	1
count	1
for	1
more	1
in	1
respiration	1
than	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
the	1
ribs.	1
The	1
sense	1
of	1
touch	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
and	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
of	1
less;	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
receiving	1
tidings	1
from	1
hand	1
and	1
eye	1
and	1
ear	1
came	1
to	1
predominate	1
over	1
the	1
part	1
for	1
receiving	1
olfactory	1
messages.	1
Finally,	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
carrying	1
the	1
infant	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
branches	1
must	1
surely	1
have	1
implied	1
an	1
intensification	1
of	1
family	1
relations,	1
and	1
favoured	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
gentleness.	1

It	1
may	1
be	1
urged	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
attaching	1
too	1
much	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship,	1
since	1
many	1
tree-loving	1
animals	1
remain	1
to-day	1
very	1
innocent	1
creatures.	1
To	1
this	1
reasonable	1
objection	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
answers,	1
first	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
many	1
acquisitions	1
the	1
arboreal	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
_humanoid_	1
precursors	1
of	1
man	1
prepared	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
survival	1
of	1
a	1
_human_	1
type	1
marked	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
step	1
in	1
brain-development;	1
and	1
second	1
that	1
the	1
passage	1
from	1
the	1
humanoid	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
was	1
probably	1
associated	1
with	1
_a	1
return	1
to	1
mother	1
earth_.	1
According	1
to	1
Professor	1
Lull,	1
to	1
whose	1
fine	1
textbook,	1
_Organic	1
Evolution_	1
(1917),	1
we	1
are	1
much	1
indebted,	1
"climatic	1
conditions	1
in	1
Asia	1
in	1
the	1
Miocene	1
or	1
early	1
Pliocene	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
compel	1
the	1
descent	1
of	1
the	1
pre-human	1
ancestor	1
from	1
the	1
trees,	1
a	1
step	1
which	1
was	1
absolutely	1
essential	1
to	1
further	1
human	1
development."	1
Continental	1
elevation	1
and	1
consequent	1
aridity	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
dwindling	1
of	1
the	1
forests,	1
and	1
forced	1
the	1
ape-man	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
earth.	1
"And	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
arose	1
the	1
man."	1
According	1
to	1
Lull,	1
the	1
descent	1
from	1
the	1
trees	1
was	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
assumption	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
erect	1
posture,	1
with	1
increased	1
liberation	1
and	1
plasticity	1
of	1
the	1
hand,	1
with	1
becoming	1
a	1
hunter,	1
with	1
experiments	1
towards	1
clothing	1
and	1
shelter,	1
with	1
an	1
exploring	1
habit,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
communal	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
plausible	1
view	1
that	1
the	1
transition	1
from	1
the	1
humanoid	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
was	1
effected	1
by	1
a	1
discontinuous	1
variation	1
of	1
considerable	1
magnitude,	1
what	1
is	1
nowadays	1
called	1
a	1
_mutation_,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
mainly	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
brain	1
and	1
the	1
vocal	1
organs.	1
But	1
given	1
the	1
gains	1
of	1
the	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship,	1
the	1
stimulus	1
of	1
an	1
enforced	1
descent	1
to	1
terra	1
firma,	1
and	1
an	1
evolving	1
brain	1
and	1
voice,	1
we	1
can	1
recognise	1
accessory	1
factors	1
which	1
helped	1
success	1
to	1
succeed.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
great	1
physical	1
strength	1
prompted	1
reliance	1
on	1
wits;	1
the	1
prolongation	1
of	1
infancy	1
would	1
help	1
to	1
educate	1
the	1
parents	1
in	1
gentleness;	1
the	1
strengthening	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
kinship	1
would	1
favour	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
family	1
and	1
social	1
life--of	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
anticipations	1
at	1
lower	1
levels.	1
There	1
is	1
much	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
saying:	1
"Man	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
society,	1
society	1
made	1
man."	1
A	1
continuation	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
will	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
the	1
primitive	1
types	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
gradual	1
ascent	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
species.	1
§	1
4	1
Tentative	1
Men	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
story	1
has	1
been	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
sifting	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
humanoid	1
stock	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
transition	1
to	1
human	1
kind,	1
from	1
the	1
ancestors	1
of	1
apes	1
and	1
men	1
to	1
the	1
man-ape,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
man-ape	1
to	1
man.	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sifting-out	1
process	1
had	1
proceeded	1
further,	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
human	1
branches	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
lead	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
modern	1
type	1
of	1
man.	1
1.	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
scanty	1
fossil	1
remains	1
known	1
as	1
_Pithecanthropus	1
erectus_,	1
found	1
in	1
Java	1
in	1
fossiliferous	1
beds	1
which	1
date	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Pliocene	1
or	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
Pleistocene	1
era.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
means	1
half	1
a	1
million	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
the	1
remains	1
occurred	1
along	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
mammals	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
extinct.	1
Unfortunately	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
Pithecanthropus	1
the	1
Erect	1
consisted	1
only	1
of	1
a	1
skull-cap,	1
a	1
thigh-bone,	1
and	1
two	1
back	1
teeth,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
surprising	1
that	1
experts	1
should	1
differ	1
considerably	1
in	1
their	1
interpretation	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
found.	1
Some	1
have	1
regarded	1
the	1
remains	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
gibbon,	1
others	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
pre-human	1
ape-man,	1
and	1
others	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
primitive	1
man	1
off	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
ascent.	1
According	1
to	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Keith,	1
Pithecanthropus	1
was	1
"a	1
being	1
human	1
in	1
stature,	1
human	1
in	1
gait,	1
human	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
parts,	1
save	1
its	1
brain."	1
The	1
thigh-bone	1
indicates	1
a	1
height	1
of	1
about	1
5	1
feet	1
7	1
inches,	1
one	1
inch	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
to-day.	1
The	1
skull-cap	1
indicates	1
a	1
low,	1
flat	1
forehead,	1
beetling	1
brows,	1
and	1
a	1
capacity	1
about	1
two-thirds	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
size.	1
The	1
remains	1
were	1
found	1
by	1
Dubois,	1
in	1
1894,	1
in	1
Trinil	1
in	1
Central	1
Java.	1
2.	1
The	1
next	1
offshoot	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
Heidelberg	1
man	1
(_Homo	1
heidelbergensis_),	1
discovered	1
near	1
Heidelberg	1
in	1
1907	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Schoetensack.	1
But	1
the	1
remains	1
consisted	1
only	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
jaw	1
and	1
its	1
teeth.	1
Along	1
with	1
this	1
relic	1
were	1
bones	1
of	1
various	1
mammals,	1
including	1
some	1
long	1
since	1
extinct	1
in	1
Europe,	1
such	1
as	1
elephant,	1
rhinoceros,	1
bison,	1
and	1
lion.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
indicate	1
an	1
age	1
of	1
perhaps	1
300,000	1
years	1
ago.	1
There	1
were	1
also	1
very	1
crude	1
flint	1
implements	1
(or	1
eoliths).	1
But	1
the	1
teeth	1
are	1
human	1
teeth,	1
and	1
the	1
jaw	1
seems	1
transitional	1
between	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
anthropoid	1
ape	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
man.	1
Thus	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chin.	1
According	1
to	1
most	1
authorities	1
the	1
lower	1
jaw	1
from	1
the	1
Heidelberg	1
sand-pit	1
must	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
relic	1
of	1
a	1
primitive	1
type	1
off	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
human	1
ascent.	1

3.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
in	1
the	1
Pliocene	1
that	1
there	1
took	1
origin	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
species	1
of	1
man,	1
_Homo	1
neanderthalensis_,	1
first	1
known	1
from	1
remains	1
found	1
in	1
1856	1
in	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
ravine	1
near	1
Düorf.	1
According	1
to	1
some	1
authorities	1
Neanderthal	1
man	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
Europe	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
million	1
years	1
ago.	1
Other	1
specimens	1
were	1
afterwards	1
found	1
elsewhere,	1
e.g.	1
in	1
Belgium	1
("the	1
men	1
of	1
Spy"),	1
in	1
France,	1
in	1
Croatia,	1
and	1
at	1
Gibraltar,	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
is	1
known	1
of	1
Neanderthal	1
man.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
loose-limbed	1
fellow,	1
short	1
of	1
stature	1
and	1
of	1
slouching	1
gait,	1
but	1
a	1
skilful	1
artificer,	1
fashioning	1
beautifully	1
worked	1
flints	1
with	1
a	1
characteristic	1
style.	1
He	1
used	1
fire;	1
he	1
buried	1
his	1
dead	1
reverently	1
and	1
furnished	1
them	1
with	1
an	1
outfit	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
journey;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
big	1
brain.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
great	1
beetling,	1
ape-like	1
eyebrow	1
ridges	1
and	1
massive	1
jaws,	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
"simian	1
characters	1
swarming	1
in	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
structure."	1
In	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
points	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
differs	1
from	1
modern	1
man	1
he	1
approaches	1
the	1
anthropoid	1
apes,	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
low	1
type	1
of	1
man	1
off	1
the	1
main	1
line.	1
Huxley	1
regarded	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
low	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
type,	1
but	1
expert	1
opinion	1
seems	1
to	1
agree	1
rather	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
maintained	1
in	1
1864	1
by	1
Professor	1
William	1
King	1
of	1
Galway,	1
that	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
man	1
represents	1
a	1
distinct	1
species	1
off	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
ascent.	1
He	1
disappeared	1
with	1
apparent	1
suddenness	1
(like	1
some	1
aboriginal	1
races	1
to-day)	1
about	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Fourth	1
Great	1
Ice	1
Age;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
evidence	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
had	1
emerged	1
a	1
successor	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
descendant--the	1
modern	1
man.	1
4.	1
Another	1
offshoot	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
is	1
probably	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
Piltdown	1
man,	1
found	1
in	1
Sussex	1
in	1
1912.	1
The	1
remains	1
consisted	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
skull,	1
which	1
indicate	1
a	1
large	1
brain,	1
and	1
a	1
high	1
forehead	1
without	1
the	1
beetling	1
eyebrows	1
of	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
man	1
and	1
Pithecanthropus.	1
The	1
"find"	1
included	1
a	1
tooth	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
jaw,	1
but	1
these	1
perhaps	1
belong	1
to	1
some	1
ape,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
discrepant.	1
The	1
Piltdown	1
skull	1
represents	1
the	1
most	1
ancient	1
human	1
remains	1
as	1
yet	1
found	1
in	1
Britain,	1
and	1
Dr.	1
Smith	1
Woodward's	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
separate	1
genus	1
Eoanthropus	1
expresses	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
the	1
Piltdown	1
man	1
was	1
off	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
type.	1
If	1
the	1
tooth	1
and	1
piece	1
of	1
lower	1
jaw	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
Piltdown	1
skull,	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
remarkable	1
combination	1
of	1
ape-like	1
and	1
human	1
characters.	1
As	1
regards	1
the	1
brain,	1
_inferred_	1
from	1
the	1
skull-walls,	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Keith	1
says:	1
All	1
the	1
essential	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
of	1
modern	1
man	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
brain	1
cast.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
primitive.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
built	1
on	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
lines	1
as	1
our	1
modern	1
brains.	1
A	1
few	1
minor	1
alterations	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
a	1
modern	1
brain....	1
Although	1
our	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
brain	1
is	1
limited--there	1
are	1
large	1
areas	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
assign	1
no	1
definite	1
function--we	1
may	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
a	1
brain	1
which	1
was	1
shaped	1
in	1
a	1
mould	1
so	1
similar	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
was	1
one	1
which	1
responded	1
to	1
the	1
outside	1
world	1
as	1
ours	1
does.	1
Piltdown	1
man	1
saw,	1
heard,	1
felt,	1
thought,	1
and	1
dreamt	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
still.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
150,000	1
years	1
ago	1
at	1
a	1
modern	1
estimate,	1
and	1
some	1
would	1
say	1
half	1
a	1
million.	1
There	1
is	1
neither	1
agreement	1
nor	1
certainty	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
man,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
modern	1
type	1
was	1
distinguishable	1
from	1
its	1
collaterals	1
hundreds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
years	1
ago.	1
The	1
general	1
impression	1
left	1
is	1
very	1
grand.	1
In	1
remote	1
antiquity	1
the	1
Primate	1
stem	1
diverged	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
orders	1
of	1
mammals;	1
it	1
sent	1
forth	1
its	1
tentative	1
branches,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
a	1
tangle	1
of	1
monkeys;	1
ages	1
passed	1
and	1
the	1
monkeys	1
were	1
left	1
behind,	1
while	1
the	1
main	1
stem,	1
still	1
probing	1
its	1
way,	1
gave	1
off	1
the	1
Anthropoid	1
apes,	1
both	1
small	1
and	1
large.	1
But	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
left	1
behind,	1
and	1
the	1
main	1
line	1
gave	1
off	1
other	1
experiments--indications	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
in	1
Java,	1
at	1
Heidelberg,	1
in	1
the	1
Neanderthal,	1
and	1
at	1
Piltdown.	1
None	1
of	1
these	1
lasted	1
or	1
was	1
made	1
perfect.	1
They	1
represent	1
_tentative_	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
their	1
day	1
and	1
ceased	1
to	1
be,	1
our	1
predecessors	1
rather	1
than	1
our	1
ancestors.	1
Still,	1
the	1
main	1
stem	1
goes	1
on	1
evolving,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
fruit	1
it	1
has	1
yet	1
to	1
bear!	1

Primitive	1
Men	1
Ancient	1
skeletons	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
type	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
many	1
places,	1
e.g.	1
Combe	1
Capelle	1
in	1
Dordogne,	1
Galley	1
Hill	1
in	1
Kent,	1
Cro-Magnon	1
in	1
Pégord,	1
Mentone	1
on	1
the	1
Riviera;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
often	1
referred	1
to	1
as	1
"Cave-men"	1
or	1
"men	1
of	1
the	1
Early	1
Stone	1
Age."	1
They	1
had	1
large	1
skulls,	1
high	1
foreheads,	1
well-marked	1
chins,	1
and	1
other	1
features	1
such	1
as	1
modern	1
man	1
possesses.	1
They	1
were	1
true	1
men	1
at	1
last--that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
like	1
ourselves!	1
The	1
spirited	1
pictures	1
they	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
caves	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
Spain	1
show	1
artistic	1
sense	1
and	1
skill.	1
Well-finished	1
statuettes	1
representing	1
nude	1
female	1
figures	1
are	1
also	1
known.	1
The	1
elaborate	1
burial	1
customs	1
point	1
to	1
a	1
belief	1
in	1
life	1
after	1
death.	1
They	1
made	1
stone	1
implements--knives,	1
scrapers,	1
gravers,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
of	1
the	1
type	1
known	1
as	1
Palæithic,	1
and	1
these	1
show	1
interesting	1
gradations	1
of	1
skill	1
and	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
style.	1
The	1
"Cave-men"	1
lived	1
between	1
the	1
third	1
and	1
fourth	1
Ice	1
Ages,	1
along	1
with	1
cave-bear,	1
cave-lion,	1
cave-hyæ,	1
mammoth,	1
woolly	1
rhinoceros,	1
Irish	1
elk,	1
and	1
other	1
mammals	1
now	1
extinct--taking	1
us	1
back	1
to	1
30,000-50,000	1
years	1
ago,	1
and	1
many	1
would	1
say	1
much	1
more.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
big-brained	1
skulls	1
of	1
these	1
Palæithic	1
cave-men	1
show	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
feature	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
called	1
primitive.	1
They	1
show	1
teeth	1
which	1
in	1
size	1
and	1
form	1
are	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
generations	1
afterwards--and	1
suffering	1
from	1
gumboil	1
too!	1
There	1
seems	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
these	1
vigorous	1
Palæithic	1
Cave-men	1
of	1
Europe	1
were	1
living	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
contemporaneously	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
Neanderthal,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly	1
hastened	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
their	1
more	1
primitive	1
collaterals.	1
Curiously	1
enough,	1
however,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
themselves	1
adequate	1
lasting	1
power	1
in	1
Europe,	1
for	1
they	1
seem	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
to	1
have	1
dwindled	1
away,	1
leaving	1
perhaps	1
stray	1
present-day	1
survivors	1
in	1
isolated	1
districts.	1
The	1
probability	1
is	1
that	1
after	1
their	1
decline	1
Europe	1
was	1
repeopled	1
by	1
immigrants	1
from	1
Asia.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
inherent	1
biological	1
necessity	1
for	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
a	1
vigorous	1
race--many	1
animal	1
races	1
go	1
back	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years--but	1
in	1
mankind	1
the	1
historical	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
great	1
racial	1
vigour	1
and	1
success	1
is	1
often	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
decline,	1
sometimes	1
leading	1
to	1
practical	1
disappearance	1
as	1
a	1
definite	1
race.	1
The	1
causes	1
of	1
this	1
waning	1
remain	1
very	1
obscure--sometimes	1
environmental,	1
sometimes	1
constitutional,	1
sometimes	1
competitive.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
parasite,	1
like	1
the	1
malaria	1
organism,	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
blame.	1
After	1
the	1
Ice	1
Ages	1
had	1
passed,	1
perhaps	1
25,000	1
years	1
ago,	1
the	1
Palæithic	1
culture	1
gave	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
Neolithic.	1
The	1
men	1
who	1
made	1
rudely	1
dressed	1
but	1
often	1
beautiful	1
stone	1
implements	1
were	1
succeeded	1
or	1
replaced	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
made	1
polished	1
stone	1
implements.	1
The	1
earliest	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Scotland	1
were	1
of	1
this	1
Neolithic	1
culture,	1
migrating	1
from	1
the	1
Continent	1
when	1
the	1
ice-fields	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Glaciation	1
had	1
disappeared.	1
Their	1
remains	1
are	1
often	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
"Fifty-foot	1
Beach"	1
which,	1
though	1
now	1
high	1
and	1
dry,	1
was	1
the	1
seashore	1
in	1
early	1
Neolithic	1
days.	1
Much	1
is	1
known	1
about	1
these	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
polished	1
stones.	1
They	1
were	1
hunters,	1
fowlers,	1
and	1
fishermen;	1
without	1
domesticated	1
animals	1
or	1
agriculture;	1
short	1
folk,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
inches	1
below	1
the	1
present	1
standard;	1
living	1
an	1
active	1
strenuous	1
life.	1
Similarly,	1
for	1
the	1
south,	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Keith	1
pictures	1
for	1
us	1
a	1
Neolithic	1
community	1
at	1
Coldrum	1
in	1
Kent,	1
dating	1
from	1
about	1
4,000	1
years	1
ago--a	1
few	1
ticks	1
of	1
the	1
geological	1
clock.	1
It	1
consisted,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
of	1
agricultural	1
pioneers,	1
men	1
with	1
large	1
heads	1
and	1
big	1
brains,	1
about	1
two	1
inches	1
shorter	1
in	1
stature	1
than	1
the	1
modern	1
British	1
average	1
(5	1
ft.	1
8	1
in.),	1
with	1
better	1
teeth	1
and	1
broader	1
palates	1
than	1
men	1
have	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
soft	1
food,	1
with	1
beliefs	1
concerning	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
similar	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
swayed	1
their	1
contemporaries	1
in	1
Western	1
and	1
Southern	1
Europe.	1
Very	1
interesting	1
is	1
the	1
manipulative	1
skill	1
they	1
showed	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
in	1
erecting	1
standing	1
stones	1
(probably	1
connected	1
with	1
calendar-keeping	1
and	1
with	1
worship),	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
small	1
scale	1
in	1
making	1
daring	1
operations	1
on	1
the	1
skull.	1
Four	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago	1
is	1
given	1
as	1
a	1
probable	1
date	1
for	1
that	1
early	1
community	1
in	1
Kent,	1
but	1
evidences	1
of	1
Neolithic	1
man	1
occur	1
in	1
situations	1
which	1
demand	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
antiquity--perhaps	1
30,000	1
years.	1
And	1
man	1
was	1
not	1
young	1
then!	1

We	1
must	1
open	1
one	1
more	1
chapter	1
in	1
the	1
thrilling	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Ascent	1
of	1
Man--the	1
Metal	1
Ages,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
sense	1
still	1
continuing.	1
Metals	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
late	1
Polished	1
Stone	1
(Neolithic)	1
times,	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
overlappings.	1
Copper	1
came	1
first,	1
Bronze	1
second,	1
and	1
Iron	1
last.	1
The	1
working	1
of	1
copper	1
in	1
the	1
East	1
has	1
been	1
traced	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
millennium	1
B.C.,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
very	1
ancient	1
Copper	1
Age	1
in	1
the	1
New	1
World.	1
It	1
need	1
hardly	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
where	1
copper	1
is	1
scarce,	1
as	1
in	1
Britain,	1
we	1
cannot	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
much	1
trace	1
of	1
a	1
Copper	1
Age.	1
The	1
ores	1
of	1
different	1
metals	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
smelted	1
together	1
in	1
an	1
experimental	1
way	1
by	1
many	1
prehistoric	1
metallurgists,	1
and	1
bronze	1
was	1
the	1
alloy	1
that	1
rewarded	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
tin	1
with	1
copper.	1
There	1
is	1
evidence	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
definite	1
Bronze	1
Age	1
in	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Babylonia,	1
Greece	1
and	1
Europe.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
clear	1
why	1
iron	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
earliest	1
metal	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
by	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
Iron	1
Age	1
dates	1
from	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
millennium	1
B.C.	1
From	1
Egypt	1
the	1
usage	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
region	1
to	1
North	1
Europe,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
discoveries	1
made	1
in	1
Central	1
Europe,	1
so	1
rich	1
in	1
iron-mines,	1
saturated	1
southwards,	1
following	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
route	1
of	1
the	1
amber	1
trade	1
from	1
the	1
Baltic.	1
Compared	1
with	1
stone,	1
the	1
metals	1
afforded	1
much	1
greater	1
possibilities	1
of	1
implements,	1
instruments,	1
and	1
weapons,	1
and	1
their	1
discovery	1
and	1
usage	1
had	1
undoubtedly	1
great	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
Ascent	1
of	1
Man.	1
Occasionally,	1
however,	1
on	1
his	1
descent.	1
Retrospect	1
Looking	1
backwards,	1
we	1
discern	1
the	1
following	1
stages:	1
(1)	1
The	1
setting	1
apart	1
of	1
a	1
Primate	1
stock,	1
marked	1
off	1
from	1
other	1
mammals	1
by	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
big	1
brains,	1
a	1
free	1
hand,	1
gregariousness,	1
and	1
good-humoured	1
talkativeness.	1
(2)	1
The	1
divergence	1
of	1
marmosets	1
and	1
New	1
World	1
monkeys	1
and	1
Old	1
World	1
monkeys,	1
leaving	1
a	1
stock--an	1
anthropoid	1
stock--common	1
to	1
the	1
present-day	1
and	1
extinct	1
apes	1
and	1
to	1
mankind.	1
(3)	1
From	1
this	1
common	1
stock	1
the	1
Anthropoid	1
apes	1
diverged,	1
far	1
from	1
ignoble	1
creatures,	1
and	1
a	1
humanoid	1
stock	1
was	1
set	1
apart.	1
(4)	1
From	1
the	1
latter	1
(we	1
follow	1
Sir	1
Arthur	1
Keith	1
and	1
other	1
authorities)	1
there	1
arose	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called,	1
without	1
disparagement,	1
tentative	1
or	1
experimental	1
men,	1
indicated	1
by	1
Pithecanthropus	1
"the	1
Erect,"	1
the	1
Heidelberg	1
man,	1
the	1
Neanderthalers,	1
and,	1
best	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
early	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
Sussex	1
Weald--hinted	1
at	1
by	1
the	1
Piltdown	1
skull.	1
It	1
matters	1
little	1
whether	1
particular	1
items	1
are	1
corroborated	1
or	1
disproved--e.g.	1
whether	1
the	1
Heidelberg	1
man	1
came	1
before	1
or	1
after	1
the	1
Neanderthalers--the	1
general	1
trend	1
of	1
evolution	1
remains	1
clear.	1
(5)	1
In	1
any	1
case,	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
_Homo	1
sapiens,	1
the	1
man	1
we	1
are_--a	1
quite	1
different	1
fellow	1
from	1
the	1
Neanderthaler.	1
(6)	1
Then	1
arose	1
various	1
stocks	1
of	1
primitive	1
men,	1
proving	1
everything	1
and	1
holding	1
fast	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
There	1
were	1
the	1
Palæithic	1
peoples,	1
with	1
rude	1
stone	1
implements,	1
a	1
strong	1
vigorous	1
race,	1
but	1
probably,	1
in	1
most	1
cases,	1
supplanted	1
by	1
fresh	1
experiments.	1
These	1
may	1
have	1
arisen	1
as	1
shoots	1
from	1
the	1
growing	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
race,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
fresh	1
offshoot	1
from	1
more	1
generalised	1
members	1
at	1
a	1
lower	1
level.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
eternal	1
possible	1
victory	1
alike	1
of	1
aristocracy	1
and	1
democracy.	1
(7)	1
Palæithic	1
men	1
were	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
succession	1
of	1
four	1
Great	1
Ice	1
Ages	1
or	1
Glaciations,	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
human	1
race	1
owes	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
alternation	1
of	1
hard	1
times	1
and	1
easy	1
times--glacial	1
and	1
interglacial.	1
When	1
the	1
ice-fields	1
cleared	1
off	1
Neolithic	1
man	1
had	1
his	1
innings.	1
(8)	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
closed	1
the	1
story,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
with	1
the	1
Metal	1
Ages.	1

THE	1
NEANDERTHAL	1
MAN	1
OF	1
LA	1
CHAPELLE-AUX-SAINTS	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
this	1
race	1
lived	1
in	1
Europe	1
from	1
the	1
Third	1
Interglacial	1
period	1
through	1
the	1
Fourth	1
Glacial.	1
They	1
disappeared	1
somewhat	1
suddenly,	1
being	1
replaced	1
by	1
the	1
Modern	1
Man	1
type,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
Cromagnards.	1
Many	1
regard	1
the	1
Neanderthal	1
Men	1
as	1
a	1
distinct	1
species.]	1
It	1
seems	1
not	1
unfitting	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
sound	1
another	1
note--that	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
feeling.	1
It	1
is	1
clear	1
in	1
William	1
James's	1
words:	1
Bone	1
of	1
our	1
bone,	1
and	1
flesh	1
of	1
our	1
flesh,	1
are	1
these	1
half-brutish	1
prehistoric	1
brothers.	1
Girdled	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
immense	1
darkness	1
of	1
this	1
mysterious	1
universe	1
even	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
they	1
were	1
born	1
and	1
died,	1
suffered	1
and	1
struggled.	1
Given	1
over	1
to	1
fearful	1
crime	1
and	1
passion,	1
plunged	1
in	1
the	1
blackest	1
ignorance,	1
preyed	1
upon	1
by	1
hideous	1
and	1
grotesque	1
delusions,	1
yet	1
steadfastly	1
serving	1
the	1
profoundest	1
of	1
ideals	1
in	1
their	1
fixed	1
faith	1
that	1
existence	1
in	1
any	1
form	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
non-existence,	1
they	1
ever	1
rescued	1
triumphantly	1
from	1
the	1
jaws	1
of	1
ever	1
imminent	1
destruction	1
the	1
torch	1
of	1
life	1
which,	1
thanks	1
to	1
them,	1
now	1
lights	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
us.	1
Races	1
of	1
Mankind	1
Given	1
a	1
variable	1
stock	1
spreading	1
over	1
diverse	1
territory,	1
we	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
splitting	1
up	1
into	1
varieties	1
which	1
may	1
become	1
steadied	1
into	1
races	1
or	1
incipient	1
species.	1
Thus	1
we	1
have	1
races	1
of	1
hive-bees,	1
"Italians,"	1
"Punics,"	1
and	1
so	1
forth;	1
and	1
thus	1
there	1
arose	1
races	1
of	1
men.	1
Certain	1
types	1
suited	1
certain	1
areas,	1
and	1
periods	1
of	1
in-breeding	1
tended	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
distinctive	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
each	1
incipient	1
race	1
well-defined	1
and	1
stable.	1
When	1
the	1
original	1
peculiarities,	1
say,	1
of	1
negro	1
and	1
Mongol,	1
Australian	1
and	1
Caucasian,	1
arose	1
as	1
brusque	1
variations	1
or	1
"mutations,"	1
then	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
great	1
staying	1
power	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation.	1
They	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
readily	1
swamped	1
by	1
intercrossing	1
or	1
averaged	1
off.	1
Peculiarities	1
and	1
changes	1
of	1
climate	1
and	1
surroundings,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
other	1
change-producing	1
factors,	1
would	1
provoke	1
new	1
departures	1
from	1
age	1
to	1
age,	1
and	1
so	1
fresh	1
racial	1
ventures	1
were	1
made.	1
Moreover,	1
the	1
occurrence	1
of	1
out-breeding	1
when	1
two	1
races	1
met,	1
in	1
peace	1
or	1
in	1
war,	1
would	1
certainly	1
serve	1
to	1
induce	1
fresh	1
starts.	1
Very	1
important	1
in	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
human	1
races	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
alternating	1
occurrence	1
of	1
periods	1
of	1
in-breeding	1
(endogamy),	1
tending	1
to	1
stability	1
and	1
sameness,	1
and	1
periods	1
of	1
out-breeding	1
(exogamy),	1
tending	1
to	1
changefulness	1
and	1
diversity.	1
Thus	1
we	1
may	1
distinguish	1
several	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
clearly	1
defined	1
primitive	1
races	1
of	1
mankind--notably	1
the	1
African,	1
the	1
Australian,	1
the	1
Mongolian,	1
and	1
the	1
Caucasian.	1
The	1
woolly-haired	1
African	1
race	1
includes	1
the	1
negroes	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
primitive	1
bushmen.	1
The	1
wavy-to	1
curly-haired	1
Australian	1
race	1
includes	1
the	1
Jungle	1
Tribes	1
of	1
the	1
Deccan,	1
the	1
Vedda	1
of	1
Ceylon,	1
the	1
Jungle	1
Folk	1
or	1
Semang,	1
and	1
the	1
natives	1
of	1
unsettled	1
parts	1
of	1
Australia--all	1
sometimes	1
slumped	1
together	1
as	1
"Pre-Dravidians."	1
The	1
straight-haired	1
Mongols	1
include	1
those	1
of	1
Tibet,	1
Indo-China,	1
China,	1
and	1
Formosa,	1
those	1
of	1
many	1
oceanic	1
islands,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
north	1
from	1
Japan	1
to	1
Lapland.	1
The	1
Caucasians	1
include	1
Mediterraneans,	1
Semites,	1
Nordics,	1
Afghans,	1
Alpines,	1
and	1
many	1
more.	1
There	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
corners	1
of	1
knowledge	1
more	1
difficult	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Races	1
of	1
Men,	1
the	1
chief	1
reason	1
being	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
movement	1
and	1
migration	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
ages.	1
One	1
physical	1
type	1
has	1
mingled	1
with	1
another,	1
inducing	1
strange	1
amalgams	1
and	1
novelties.	1
If	1
we	1
start	1
with	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
"zoological"	1
races	1
or	1
strains	1
differing,	1
for	1
instance,	1
in	1
their	1
hair	1
(woolly-haired	1
Africans,	1
straight-haired	1
Mongols,	1
curly-or	1
wavy-haired	1
Pre-Dravidians	1
and	1
Caucasians),	1
we	1
find	1
these	1
replaced	1
by	1
_peoples_	1
who	1
are	1
mixtures	1
of	1
various	1
races,	1
"brethren	1
by	1
civilisation	1
more	1
than	1
by	1
blood."	1
As	1
Professor	1
Flinders	1
Petrie	1
has	1
said,	1
the	1
only	1
meaning	1
the	1
term	1
"race"	1
now	1
can	1
have	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
human	1
beings	1
whose	1
type	1
has	1
been	1
unified	1
by	1
their	1
rate	1
of	1
assimilation	1
exceeding	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
change	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
infiltration	1
of	1
foreign	1
elements.	1
It	1
is	1
probable,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
precise	1
anthropology	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
possible	1

For	1
the	1

it	1

Steps	1
in	1
Human	1
Evolution	1
Real	1
men	1
arose,	1
we	1
believe,	1
by	1
variational	1
uplifts	1
of	1
considerable	1
magnitude	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
big	1
and	1
complex	1
brains	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
reasoned	1
discourse.	1
In	1
some	1
other	1
lines	1
of	1
mammalian	1
evolution	1
there	1
were	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
great	1
advances	1
in	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1
brain,	1
as	1
is	1
clear,	1
for	1
instance,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
horses	1
and	1
elephants.	1
The	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
birds	1
as	1
compared	1
with	1
reptiles,	1
and	1
everyone	1
recognises	1
the	1
high	1
level	1
of	1
excellence	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
attained	1
by	1
their	1
vocal	1
powers.	1
How	1
these	1
great	1
cerebral	1
advances	1
came	1
about	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
main	1
trends	1
of	1
animal	1
evolution	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
nervous	1
system.	1
Two	1
suggestions	1
may	1
be	1
made.	1
First,	1
the	1
prolongation	1
of	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
ante-natal	1
life,	1
in	1
intimate	1
physiological	1
partnership	1
with	1
the	1
mother,	1
may	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
practicable	1
to	1
start	1
the	1
higher	1
mammal	1
with	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
brain	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
orders,	1
like	1
Insectivores	1
and	1
Rodents,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
Marsupials,	1
where	1
the	1
period	1
before	1
birth	1
(gestation)	1
is	1
short.	1
Second,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
individual	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
is	1
profoundly	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
internal	1
secretions	1
of	1
certain	1
ductless	1
glands	1
notably	1
the	1
thyroid.	1
When	1
this	1
organ	1
is	1
not	1
functioning	1
properly	1
the	1
child's	1
brain	1
development	1
is	1
arrested.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
increased	1
production	1
of	1
certain	1
hormones--itself,	1
of	1
course,	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
for--may	1
have	1
stimulated	1
brain	1
development	1
in	1
man's	1
remote	1
ancestors.	1
Given	1
variability	1
along	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
better	1
brains	1
and	1
given	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
discriminate	1
sifting	1
which	1
would	1
consistently	1
offer	1
rewards	1
to	1
alertness	1
and	1
foresight,	1
to	1
kin-sympathy	1
and	1
parental	1
care,	1
there	1
seems	1
no	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
imagining	1
how	1
Man	1
would	1
evolve.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
an	1
Aristotle	1
or	1
a	1
Newton	1
except	1
as	1
fine	1
results	1
which	1
justify	1
all	1
the	1
groaning	1
and	1
travailing;	1
we	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
average	1
men,	1
of	1
primitive	1
peoples	1
to-day,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
forbears	1
long	1
ago.	1
We	1
must	1
remember	1
how	1
much	1
of	1
man's	1
advance	1
is	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
external	1
registration	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
heritage,	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
slowly	1
changing	1
natural	1
inheritance.	1
Looking	1
backwards	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
we	1
think,	1
to	1
fail	1
to	1
recognise	1
progress.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
fine	1
description	1
Æchylus	1
gave	1
of	1
primitive	1
men	1
that--	1
first,	1
beholding	1
they	1
beheld	1
in	1
vain,	1
and,	1
hearing,	1
heard	1
not,	1
but,	1
like	1
shapes	1
in	1
dreams,	1
mixed	1
all	1
things	1
wildly	1
down	1
the	1
tedious	1
time,	1
nor	1
knew	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
house	1
against	1
the	1
sun	1
with	1
wicketed	1
sides,	1
nor	1
any	1
woodwork	1
knew,	1
but	1
lived	1
like	1
silly	1
ants,	1
beneath	1
the	1
ground,	1
in	1
hollow	1
caves	1
unsunned.	1
There	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
no	1
steadfast	1
sign	1
of	1
winter,	1
nor	1
of	1
spring	1
flower-perfumed,	1
nor	1
of	1
summer	1
full	1
of	1
fruit,	1
but	1
blindly	1
and	1
lawlessly	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
things.	1
Contrast	1
this	1
picture	1
with	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
man	1
to-day.	1
He	1
has	1
mastered	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
Nature	1
and	1
is	1
learning	1
to	1
use	1
their	1
resources	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
economically;	1
he	1
has	1
harnessed	1
electricity	1
to	1
his	1
chariot	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
the	1
ether	1
carry	1
his	1
messages.	1
He	1
tapped	1
supplies	1
of	1
material	1
which	1
seemed	1
for	1
centuries	1
unavailable,	1
having	1
learned,	1
for	1
instance,	1
how	1
to	1
capture	1
and	1
utilise	1
the	1
free	1
nitrogen	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
With	1
his	1
telegraph	1
and	1
"wireless"	1
he	1
has	1
annihilated	1
distance,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
added	1
to	1
his	1
navigable	1
kingdom	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
the	1
heights	1
of	1
the	1
air.	1
He	1
has	1
conquered	1
one	1
disease	1
after	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
science	1
of	1
heredity	1
is	1
showing	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
control	1
in	1
his	1
domesticated	1
animals	1
and	1
cultivated	1
plants	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
generations	1
yet	1
unborn.	1
With	1
all	1
his	1
faults	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
ethical	1
face	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
direction.	1
The	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
movement	1
is	1
towards	1
the	1
fuller	1
embodiment	1
of	1
the	1
true,	1
the	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
in	1
healthy	1
lives	1
which	1
are	1
increasingly	1
a	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
themselves.	1

Factors	1
in	1
Human	1
Progress	1
Many,	1
we	1
believe,	1
were	1
the	1
gains	1
that	1
rewarded	1
the	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship	1
of	1
man's	1
ancestors.	1
Many,	1
likewise,	1
were	1
the	1
results	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
coming	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
solid	1
earth--a	1
transition	1
which	1
marked	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
tentative	1
men.	1
What	1
great	1
steps	1
followed?	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
were--the	1
working	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
spoken	1
language	1
and	1
of	1
external	1
methods	1
of	1
registration;	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
tools;	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
fire;	1
the	1
utilisation	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
other	1
metals;	1
the	1
taming	1
of	1
wild	1
animals	1
such	1
as	1
dog	1
and	1
sheep,	1
horses	1
and	1
cattle;	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
wild	1
plants	1
such	1
as	1
wheat	1
and	1
rice;	1
and	1
the	1
irrigation	1
of	1
fields.	1
All	1
through	1
the	1
ages	1
necessity	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
invention	1
and	1
curiosity	1
its	1
father;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
we	1
miss	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
if	1
we	1
forget	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
some	1
leisure	1
time--wherein	1
to	1
observe	1
and	1
think.	1
If	1
our	1
earth	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
clouded	1
that	1
the	1
stars	1
were	1
hidden	1
from	1
men's	1
eyes	1
the	1
whole	1
history	1
of	1
our	1
race	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
different.	1
For	1
it	1
was	1
through	1
his	1
leisure-time	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
that	1
early	1
man	1
discovered	1
the	1
regularity	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
and	1
got	1
his	1
fundamental	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
Nature--on	1
which	1
all	1
his	1
science	1
is	1
founded.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
think	1
clearly	1
of	1
the	1
factors	1
of	1
human	1
progress	1
we	1
must	1
recall	1
the	1
three	1
great	1
biological	1
ideas--the	1
living	1
organism,	1
its	1
environment,	1
and	1
its	1
functioning.	1
For	1
man	1
these	1
mean	1
(1)	1
the	1
living	1
creature,	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
parents	1
and	1
ancestors,	1
a	1
fresh	1
expression	1
of	1
a	1
bodily	1
and	1
mental	1
inheritance;	1
(2)	1
the	1
surroundings,	1
including	1
climate	1
and	1
soil,	1
the	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
these	1
allow;	1
and	1
(3)	1
the	1
activities	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
occupations	1
and	1
habits,	1
all	1
the	1
actions	1
and	1
reactions	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
his	1
milieu.	1
In	1
short,	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
FOLK,	1
PLACE,	1
WORK;	1
the	1
_Famille_,	1
_Lieu_,	1
_Travail_	1
of	1
the	1
LePlay	1
school.	1
As	1
to	1
FOLK,	1
human	1
progress	1
depends	1
on	1
intrinsic	1
racial	1
qualities--notably	1
health	1
and	1
vigour	1
of	1
body,	1
clearness	1
and	1
alertness	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
an	1
indispensable	1
sociality.	1
The	1
most	1
powerful	1
factors	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
clear	1
ideas	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
energetic	1
men	1
of	1
good	1
will.	1
The	1
differences	1
in	1
bodily	1
and	1
mental	1
health	1
which	1
mark	1
races,	1
and	1
stocks	1
within	1
a	1
people,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
mark	1
individuals,	1
are	1
themselves	1
traceable	1
back	1
to	1
germinal	1
variations	1
or	1
mutations,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
sifting	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
race	1
or	1
stock	1
has	1
been	1
subjected.	1
Easygoing	1
conditions	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
stimulus	1
to	1
new	1
departures,	1
they	1
are	1
without	1
the	1
sifting	1
which	1
progress	1
demands.	1
As	1
to	1
PLACE,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
different	1
areas	1
differ	1
greatly	1
in	1
their	1
material	1
resources	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
availability	1
of	1
these.	1
Moreover,	1
even	1
when	1
abundant	1
material	1
resources	1
are	1
present,	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
for	1
much	1
progress	1
unless	1
the	1
climate	1
is	1
such	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
readily	1
utilised.	1
Indeed,	1
climate	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
factors	1
in	1
civilisation,	1
here	1
stimulating	1
and	1
there	1
depressing	1
energy,	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
favouring	1
certain	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
important	1
to	1
man,	1
in	1
another	1
place	1
preventing	1
their	1
presence.	1
Moreover,	1
climate	1
has	1
slowly	1
changed	1
from	1
age	1
to	1
age.	1
As	1
to	1
WORK,	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
civilisation	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
primary	1
occupations,	1
whether	1
hunting	1
or	1
fishing,	1
farming	1
or	1
shepherding;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
industries	1
of	1
later	1
ages	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
profound	1
moulding	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
individual	1
at	1
least.	1
We	1
cannot,	1
however,	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
factors	1
of	1
human	1
progress	1
have	1
always	1
had	1
these	1
three	1
aspects,	1
Folk,	1
Place,	1
Work,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
progress	1
is	1
to	1
continue	1
on	1
stable	1
lines	1
it	1
must	1
always	1
recognise	1
the	1
essential	1
correlation	1
of	1
fitter	1
folk	1
in	1
body	1
and	1
mind:	1
improved	1
habits	1
and	1
functions,	1
alike	1
in	1
work	1
and	1
leisure;	1
and	1
bettered	1
surroundings	1
in	1
the	1
widest	1
and	1
deepest	1
sense.	1

EVOLUTION	1
GOING	1
ON	1
Evolution,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
chapter,	1
is	1
another	1
word	1
for	1
race-history.	1
It	1
means	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
process	1
of	1
Becoming,	1
linking	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
of	1
living	1
creatures.	1
The	1
Doctrine	1
of	1
Evolution	1
states	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
the	1
future.	1
It	1
comes	1
to	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
plants	1
and	1
animals	1
we	1
know	1
are	1
descended	1
from	1
ancestors	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
simpler,	1
and	1
these	1
from	1
others	1
likewise	1
simpler,	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
back	1
and	1
back--till	1
we	1
reach	1
the	1
first	1
living	1
creatures,	1
of	1
which,	1
unfortunately,	1
we	1
know	1
nothing.	1
Evolution	1
is	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
racial	1
change	1
in	1
a	1
definite	1
direction,	1
whereby	1
new	1
forms	1
arise,	1
take	1
root,	1
and	1
flourish,	1
alongside	1
of	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
ancestors,	1
which	1
were	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
rather	1
simpler	1
in	1
structure	1
and	1
behaviour.	1
The	1
rock-record,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
wrong,	1
though	1
we	1
may	1
read	1
it	1
wrongly,	1
shows	1
clearly	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
once	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Earth	1
when	1
the	1
only	1
backboned	1
animals	1
were	1
Fishes.	1
Ages	1
passed,	1
and	1
there	1
evolved	1
Amphibians,	1
with	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes,	1
scrambling	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land.	1
Ages	1
passed,	1
and	1
there	1
evolved	1
Reptiles,	1
in	1
bewildering	1
profusion.	1
There	1
were	1
fish-lizards	1
and	1
sea-serpents,	1
terrestrial	1
dragons	1
and	1
flying	1
dragons,	1
a	1
prolific	1
and	1
varied	1
stock.	1
From	1
the	1
terrestrial	1
Dinosaurs	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
Birds	1
and	1
Mammals	1
arose.	1
In	1
succeeding	1
ages	1
there	1
evolved	1
all	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
Birds	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
Mammals.	1
Until	1
at	1
last	1
arose	1
the	1
Man.	1
The	1
question	1
is	1
whether	1
similar	1
processes	1
of	1
evolution	1
are	1
still	1
going	1
on.	1
We	1
are	1
so	1
keenly	1
aware	1
of	1
rapid	1
changes	1
in	1
mankind,	1
though	1
these	1
concern	1
the	1
social	1
heritage	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
flesh-and-blood	1
natural	1
inheritance,	1
that	1
we	1
find	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
mankind.	1
We	1
know	1
the	1
contrast	1
between	1
modern	1
man	1
and	1
primitive	1
man,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
convinced	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
past,	1
at	1
least,	1
progress	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
reality.	1
That	1
degeneration	1
may	1
set	1
in	1
is	1
an	1
awful	1
possibility--involution	1
rather	1
than	1
evolution--but	1
even	1
if	1
going	1
back	1
became	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
the	1
rule,	1
we	1
cannot	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
race	1
would	1
recover	1
itself	1
and	1
begin	1
afresh	1
to	1
go	1
forward.	1
For	1
although	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
retrogressions	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
life,	1
continued	1
through	1
unthinkably	1
long	1
ages,	1
and	1
although	1
great	1
races,	1
the	1
Flying	1
Dragons	1
for	1
instance,	1
have	1
become	1
utterly	1
extinct,	1
leaving	1
no	1
successors	1
whatsoever,	1
we	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
a	1
progress	1
towards	1
nobler,	1
more	1
masterful,	1
more	1
emancipated,	1
more	1
intelligent,	1
and	1
_better_	1
forms	1
of	1
life--a	1
progress	1
towards	1
what	1
mankind	1
at	1
its	1
best	1
has	1
always	1
regarded	1
as	1
best,	1
i.e.	1
affording	1
most	1
enduring	1
satisfaction.	1
So	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
evolution	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
mankind,	1
evolution	1
chequered	1
by	1
involution,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
_progressive	1
evolution_.	1
Evolutionary	1
Prospect	1
for	1
Man	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
man's	1
body	1
will	1
admit	1
of	1
_great_	1
change,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
room	1
for	1
some	1
improvement,	1
e.g.	1
in	1
the	1
superfluous	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
food-canal	1
and	1
the	1
overcrowding	1
of	1
the	1
teeth.	1
It	1
is	1
likely,	1
however,	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
constitutional	1
changes,	1
e.g.	1
of	1
prolonged	1
youthfulness,	1
a	1
higher	1
standard	1
of	1
healthfulness,	1
and	1
a	1
greater	1
resistance	1
to	1
disease.	1
It	1
is	1
justifiable	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
great	1
improvements	1
in	1
intelligence	1
and	1
in	1
control.	1
The	1
potentialities	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
brain,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
utilised	1
to	1
the	1
full,	1
and	1
new	1
departures	1
of	1
promise	1
are	1
of	1
continual	1
occurrence.	1
What	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
departures	1
or	1
variations	1
which	1
emerge	1
in	1
fine	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
fostered,	1
not	1
nipped	1
in	1
the	1
bud,	1
by	1
the	1
social	1
environment,	1
education	1
included.	1
The	1
evolutionary	1
prospect	1
for	1
man	1
is	1
promising.	1

through	1
the	1
Pearly	1
Nautilus,	1
_Nautilus	1
pompilius_,	1
common	1
from	1
Malay	1
to	1
Fiji.	1
The	1
shell	1
is	1
often	1
about	1
9	1
inches	1
long.	1
The	1
animal	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chamber	1
only,	1
but	1
a	1
tube	1
(S)	1
runs	1
through	1
the	1
empty	1
chambers,	1
perforating	1
the	1
partitions	1
(SE).	1
The	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
marked	1
VM;	1
the	1
eye	1
is	1
shown	1
at	1
E;	1
a	1
hood	1
is	1
marked	1
H;	1
round	1
the	1
mouth	1
there	1
are	1
numerous	1
lobes	1
(L)	1
bearing	1
protrusible	1
tentacles,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
shown.	1
When	1
the	1
animal	1
is	1
swimming	1
near	1
the	1
surface	1
the	1
tentacles	1
radiate	1
out	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
described	1
as	1
"a	1
shell	1
with	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
cauliflower	1
sticking	1
out	1
of	1
it."	1
The	1
Pearly	1
Nautilus	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
example	1
of	1
a	1
conservative	1
type,	1
for	1
it	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
Triassic	1
Era.	1
But	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Nautiloids	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
belongs	1
illustrates	1
very	1
vividly	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
a	1
dwindling	1
race.	1
The	1
Nautiloids	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
Cambrian,	1
reached	1
their	1
golden	1
age	1
in	1
the	1
Silurian,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
decline	1
markedly	1
in	1
the	1
Carboniferous.	1
There	1
are	1
2,500	1
extinct	1
or	1
fossil	1
species	1
of	1
Nautiloids,	1
and	1
only	1
4	1
living	1
to-day.]	1

A	1
bird	1
of	1
a	1
savage	1
nature,	1
never	1
mixing	1
with	1
other	1
marsh	1
birds.	1
According	1
to	1
Dr.	1
Chalmers	1
Mitchell,	1
it	1
shows	1
affinities	1
to	1
herons,	1
storks,	1
pelicans,	1
and	1
gannets,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
representative	1
of	1
a	1
type	1
equal	1
to	1
both	1
herons	1
and	1
storks	1
and	1
falling	1
between	1
the	1
two.]	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
important	1
to	1
realise	1
that	1
among	1
plant	1
and	1
animals	1
likewise,	1
_Evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on_.	1
The	1
Fountain	1
of	1
Change:	1
Variability	1
On	1
an	1
ordinary	1
big	1
clock	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
readily	1
see	1
that	1
even	1
the	1
minute	1
hand	1
is	1
moving,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
only	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
years	1
we	1
can	1
conceive	1
of	1
people	1
arguing	1
whether	1
the	1
hands	1
did	1
really	1
move	1
at	1
all.	1
So	1
it	1
often	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
go	1
on	1
from	1
generation	1
to	1
generation	1
in	1
living	1
creatures.	1
The	1
flux	1
is	1
so	1
slow,	1
like	1
the	1
flowing	1
of	1
a	1
glacier,	1
that	1
some	1
people	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
its	1
reality.	1
And	1
it	1
must,	1
of	1
course,	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
some	1
kinds	1
of	1
living	1
creatures,	1
like	1
the	1
Lamp-shell	1
_Ligula_	1
or	1
the	1
Pearly	1
Nautilus,	1
hardly	1
change	1
from	1
age	1
to	1
age,	1
whereas	1
others,	1
like	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
and	1
butterflies,	1
are	1
always	1
giving	1
rise	1
to	1
something	1
new.	1
The	1
Evening	1
Primrose	1
among	1
plants,	1
and	1
the	1
Fruit-fly,	1
Drosophila,	1
among	1
animals,	1
are	1
well-known	1
examples	1
of	1
organisms	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
present	1
in	1
a	1
sporting	1
or	1
mutating	1
mood.	1
Certain	1
dark	1
varieties	1
of	1
moth,	1
e.g.	1
of	1
the	1
Peppered	1
Moth,	1
are	1
taking	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
paler	1
type	1
in	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
England,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
some	1
dark	1
forms	1
of	1
Sugar-bird	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indian	1
islands.	1
Very	1
important	1
is	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
statistics	1
worked	1
out	1
by	1
Professor	1
R.	1
C.	1
Punnett,	1
that	1
"if	1
a	1
population	1
contains	1
.001	1
per	1
cent	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
variety,	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
variety	1
has	1
even	1
a	1
5	1
per	1
cent	1
selection	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
original	1
form,	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
almost	1
completely	1
disappear	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
generations."	1
This	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
on	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
untold	1
ages,	1
and	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
animate	1
nature	1
has	1
consequently	1
changed.	1
We	1
are	1
impressed	1
by	1
striking	1
novelties	1
that	1
crop	1
up--a	1
clever	1
dwarf,	1
a	1
musical	1
genius,	1
a	1
calculating	1
boy,	1
a	1
cock	1
with	1
a	1
10	1
ft.	1
tail,	1
a	1
"wonder-horse"	1
with	1
a	1
mane	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
a	1
tailless	1
cat,	1
a	1
white	1
blackbird,	1
a	1
copper	1
beech,	1
a	1
Greater	1
Celandine	1
with	1
much	1
cut	1
up	1
leaves;	1
but	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
mutation	1
is	1
common,	1
and	1
smaller,	1
less	1
brusque	1
variations	1
are	1
commoner	1
still.	1
_They	1
form	1
the	1
raw	1
materials	1
of	1
possible	1
evolution._	1
We	1
are	1
actually	1
standing	1
before	1
an	1
apparently	1
inexhaustible	1
fountain	1
of	1
change.	1
This	1
is	1
evolution	1
going	1
on.	1
The	1
Sporting	1
Jellyfish	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
consider	1
a	1
common	1
animal	1
like	1
the	1
jellyfish	1
Aurelia.	1
It	1
is	1
admirably	1
suited	1
for	1
a	1
leisurely	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
where	1
it	1
swims	1
about	1
by	1
contracting	1
its	1
saucer-shaped	1
body,	1
thus	1
driving	1
water	1
out	1
from	1
its	1
concavity.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
stinging	1
cells	1
on	1
its	1
four	1
frilled	1
lips	1
and	1
on	1
its	1
marginal	1
tentacles	1
it	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
paralyse	1
and	1
lasso	1
minute	1
crustaceans	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
which	1
it	1
then	1
wafts	1
into	1
its	1
mouth.	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
eventful	1
life-history,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
in	1
its	1
early	1
youth	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
a	1
fixed	1
stage,	1
fastened	1
to	1
rock	1
or	1
seaweed,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
successful	1
animal,	1
well	1
suited	1
for	1
its	1
habitat,	1
and	1
practically	1
cosmopolitan	1
in	1
its	1
distribution.	1
It	1
is	1
certainly	1
an	1
old-established	1
creature.	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
variable	1
in	1
colour	1
and	1
in	1
size,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
internal	1
structure.	1
Very	1
often	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
saucer	1
or	1
a	1
soup-plate,	1
but	1
giants	1
over	1
two	1
feet	1
in	1
diameter	1
are	1
well	1
known.	1
Much	1
more	1
important,	1
however,	1
than	1
variation	1
in	1
colour	1
and	1
size	1
are	1
the	1
inborn	1
changes	1
in	1
structure.	1
Normally	1
a	1
jellyfish	1
has	1
its	1
parts	1
in	1
four	1
or	1
multiples	1
of	1
four.	1
Thus	1
it	1
has	1
four	1
frilled	1
lips,	1
four	1
tufts	1
of	1
digestive	1
filaments	1
in	1
its	1
stomach,	1
and	1
four	1
brightly	1
coloured	1
reproductive	1
organs.	1
It	1
has	1
eight	1
sense-organs	1
round	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
its	1
disc,	1
eight	1
branched	1
and	1
eight	1
unbranched	1
radial	1
canals	1
running	1
from	1
the	1
central	1
stomach	1
to	1
a	1
canal	1
round	1
the	1
circumference.	1
The	1
point	1
of	1
giving	1
these	1
details	1
is	1
just	1
this,	1
that	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
jellyfish	1
with	1
its	1
parts	1
in	1
sixes,	1
fives,	1
or	1
threes,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
minor	1
idiosyncrasies.	1
_Even	1
in	1
the	1
well-established	1
jellyfish	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fountain	1
of	1
change._	1
§	1

Evolution	1
of	1
Plants	1
It	1
is	1
instructive	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
various	1
kinds	1
of	1
cabbages,	1
such	1
as	1
cauliflower	1
and	1
Brussels	1
sprouts,	1
kale	1
and	1
curly	1
greens,	1
and	1
remember	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
scions	1
of	1
the	1
not	1
very	1
promising	1
wild	1
cabbage	1
found	1
on	1
our	1
shores.	1
And	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
aristocrat	1
apple-trees	1
of	1
our	1
orchards	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
plebeian	1
crab-apple	1
of	1
the	1
roadside?	1
We	1
know	1
far	1
too	1
little	1
about	1
the	1
precise	1
origin	1
of	1
our	1
cultivated	1
plants,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
after	1
man	1
got	1
a	1
hold	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
their	1
variability	1
to	1
establish	1
race	1
after	1
race,	1
say,	1
of	1
rose	1
and	1
chrysanthemum,	1
of	1
potato	1
and	1
cereal.	1
The	1
evolution	1
of	1
cultivated	1
plants	1
is	1
continuing	1
before	1
our	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
creations	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Luther	1
Burbank,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
stoneless	1
plum	1
and	1
the	1
primus	1
berry,	1
the	1
spineless	1
cactus	1
and	1
the	1
Shasta	1
daisy,	1
are	1
merely	1
striking	1
instances	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
always	1
going	1
on.	1
There	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
domestic	1
dog	1
has	1
risen	1
three	1
times,	1
from	1
three	1
distinct	1
ancestors--a	1
wolf,	1
a	1
jackal,	1
and	1
a	1
coyote.	1
So	1
a	1
multiple	1
pedigree	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
dog,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
is	1
true	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
domesticated	1
animals.	1
But	1
the	1
big	1
fact	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
breeds	1
that	1
man	1
has	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
fix,	1
after	1
he	1
once	1
got	1
started	1
with	1
a	1
domesticated	1
type.	1
There	1
are	1
over	1
200	1
well-marked	1
breeds	1
of	1
domestic	1
pigeons,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
very	1
strong	1
evidence	1
that	1
all	1
are	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
wild	1
rock-dove,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
numerous	1
kinds	1
of	1
poultry	1
are	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
jungle-fowl	1
of	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
India	1
and	1
the	1
Malay	1
Islands.	1
Even	1
more	1
familiar	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
man	1
has,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
unpacked	1
the	1
complex	1
fur	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
rabbit,	1
and	1
established	1
all	1
the	1
numerous	1
colour-varieties	1
which	1
we	1
see	1
among	1
domestic	1
rabbits.	1
And	1
apart	1
from	1
colour-varieties	1
there	1
are	1
long-haired	1
Angoras	1
and	1
quaint	1
lop-eared	1
forms,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
besides.	1
All	1
this	1
points	1
to	1
evolution	1
going	1
on.	1
The	1
Romance	1
of	1
the	1
Wheat	1
It	1
is	1
well-known	1
that	1
Neolithic	1
man	1
grew	1
wheat,	1
and	1
some	1
authorities	1
have	1
put	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
wheat	1
harvest	1
at	1
between	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
and	1
ten	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago.	1
The	1
ancient	1
civilisations	1
of	1
Babylonia,	1
Egypt,	1
Crete,	1
Greece,	1
and	1
Rome	1
were	1
largely	1
based	1
on	1
wheat,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
great	1
wheatfields	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
fertile	1
land	1
between	1
the	1
Tigris	1
and	1
the	1
Euphrates.	1
The	1
oldest	1
Egyptian	1
tombs	1
that	1
contain	1
wheat,	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
never	1
germinates	1
after	1
its	1
millennia	1
of	1
rest,	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Dynasty,	1
and	1
are	1
about	1
six	1
thousand	1
years	1
old.	1
But	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
long	1
history	1
of	1
wheat	1
before	1
that.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
almost	1
certain	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
cultivated	1
wheat	1
is	1
at	1
present	1
living	1
on	1
the	1
arid	1
and	1
rocky	1
slopes	1
of	1
Mount	1
Hermon.	1
It	1
is	1
called	1
_Triticum	1
hermonis_,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
varying	1
notably	1
to-day,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
long	1
ago	1
when	1
it	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
emmer,	1
which	1
was	1
cultivated	1
in	1
the	1
Neolithic	1
Age	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
ancestor	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
ordinary	1
wheats.	1
We	1
must	1
think	1
of	1
Neolithic	1
man	1
noticing	1
the	1
big	1
seeds	1
of	1
this	1
Hermon	1
grass,	1
gathering	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
heads,	1
breaking	1
the	1
brittle	1
spikelet-bearing	1
axis	1
in	1
his	1
fingers,	1
knocking	1
off	1
the	1
rough	1
awns	1
or	1
bruising	1
the	1
spikelets	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
till	1
the	1
glumes	1
or	1
chaff	1
separated	1
off	1
and	1
could	1
be	1
blown	1
away,	1
chewing	1
a	1
mouthful	1
of	1
the	1
seeds--and	1
resolving	1
to	1
sow	1
and	1
sow	1
again.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
story,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
man	1
took	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
variations	1
that	1
cropped	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
sporting	1
stock	1
and	1
established	1
one	1
successful	1
race	1
after	1
another	1
on	1
his	1
fields.	1
Virgil	1
refers	1
in	1
the	1
"Georgics"	1
to	1
the	1
gathering	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
and	1
fullest	1
ears	1
of	1
wheat	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
good	1
seed	1
for	1
another	1
sowing,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
first	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
step	1
was	1
taken,	1
by	1
men	1
like	1
Patrick	1
Sheriff	1
of	1
Haddington,	1
of	1
deliberately	1
selecting	1
individual	1
ears	1
of	1
great	1
excellence	1
and	1
segregating	1
their	1
progeny	1
from	1
mingling	1
with	1
mediocre	1
stock.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
method	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
followed	1
with	1
remarkable	1
success	1
in	1
modern	1
times.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
factors	1
that	1
assisted	1
the	1
Allies	1
in	1
overcoming	1
the	1
food	1
crisis	1
in	1
the	1
darkest	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
was	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
Marquis	1
Wheat,	1
a	1
very	1
prolific,	1
early	1
ripening,	1
hard	1
red	1
spring	1
wheat	1
with	1
excellent	1
milling	1
and	1
baking	1
qualities.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
dominant	1
spring	1
wheat	1
in	1
Canada	1
and	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
enormously	1
increased	1
the	1
real	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
ten	1
years	1
(1921).	1
Now	1
our	1
point	1
is	1
simply	1
that	1
this	1
Marquis	1
Wheat	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
example	1
of	1
evolution	1
going	1
on.	1
In	1
1917	1
upwards	1
of	1
250,000,000	1
bushels	1
of	1
this	1
wheat	1
were	1
raised	1
in	1
North	1
America,	1
and	1
in	1
1918	1
upwards	1
of	1
300,000,000	1
bushels;	1
yet	1
the	1
whole	1
originated	1
from	1
a	1
single	1
grain	1
planted	1
in	1
an	1
experimental	1
plot	1
at	1
Ottawa	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Charles	1
E.	1
Saunders	1
so	1
recently	1
as	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
1903.	1

We	1
must	1
not	1
dwell	1
too	1
long	1
on	1
this	1
particular	1
instance	1
of	1
evolution,	1
though	1
it	1
has	1
meant	1
much	1
to	1
our	1
race.	1
We	1
wish,	1
however,	1
following	1
Professor	1
Buller's	1
_Essays	1
on	1
Wheat_	1
(1919),	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
method	1
by	1
which	1
this	1
good	1
seed	1
was	1
discovered.	1
From	1
one	1
we	1
may	1
learn	1
all.	1
The	1
parent	1
of	1
Marquis	1
Wheat	1
on	1
the	1
male	1
side	1
was	1
the	1
mid-Europe	1
Red	1
Fife--a	1
first-class	1
cereal.	1
The	1
parent	1
on	1
the	1
female	1
side	1
was	1
less	1
promising,	1
a	1
rather	1
nondescript,	1
not	1
pure-bred	1
wheat,	1
called	1
Red	1
Calcutta,	1
which	1
was	1
imported	1
from	1
India	1
into	1
Canada	1
about	1
thirty	1
years	1
ago.	1
The	1
father	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
cargo	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
Baltic	1
to	1
Glasgow,	1
and	1
was	1
happily	1
included	1
in	1
a	1
sample	1
sent	1
on	1
to	1
David	1
Fife	1
in	1
Ontario	1
about	1
1842.	1
From	1
one	1
kernel	1
of	1
this	1
sample	1
David	1
Fife	1
started	1
his	1
stock	1
of	1
Red	1
Fife,	1
which	1
was	1
crossed	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Saunders	1
with	1
Hard	1
Red	1
Calcutta.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
was	1
a	1
medley	1
of	1
types,	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
varieties	1
altogether,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
scrutinising	1
these	1
that	1
Dr.	1
Saunders	1
hit	1
upon	1
Marquis.	1
He	1
worked	1
steadily	1
through	1
the	1
material,	1
studying	1
head	1
after	1
head	1
of	1
what	1
resulted	1
from	1
sowing,	1
and	1
selecting	1
out	1
those	1
that	1
gave	1
most	1
promise.	1
Each	1
of	1
the	1
heads	1
selected	1
was	1
propagated;	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
results	1
were	1
rejected;	1
the	1
elect	1
were	1
sifted	1
again	1
and	1
yet	1
again,	1
and	1
finally	1
Marquis	1
Wheat	1
emerged,	1
rich	1
in	1
constructive	1
possibilities,	1
probably	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
food-plant	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
romance	1
to	1
read	1
that	1
"the	1
first	1
crop	1
of	1
the	1
wheat	1
that	1
was	1
destined	1
within	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
to	1
overtax	1
the	1
mightiest	1
elevators	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
was	1
stored	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
of	1
1904-5	1
in	1
a	1
paper	1
packet	1
no	1
larger	1
than	1
an	1
envelope."	1
Thus	1
from	1
the	1
Wild	1
Wheat	1
of	1
Mount	1
Hermon	1
there	1
evolved	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
food-plants	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
This	1
surely	1
is	1
_Evolution	1
going	1
on_.	1
§	1

Changes	1
in	1
the	1
Animal	1
Life	1
of	1
a	1
Country	1
Nothing	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
more	1
convincing	1
impression	1
of	1
evolution	1
in	1
being	1
than	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
pictures	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
in	1
different	1
ages.	1
Dr.	1
James	1
Ritchie,	1
a	1
naturalist	1
of	1
distinction,	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
masterly	1
book,	1
_The	1
Influence	1
of	1
Man	1
on	1
Animal	1
Life	1
in	1
Scotland_	1
(1920),	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
get	1
this	1
succession	1
of	1
pictures.	1
"Within	1
itself,"	1
he	1
says,	1
"a	1
fauna	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
constant	1
state	1
of	1
uneasy	1
restlessness,	1
an	1
assemblage	1
of	1
creatures	1
which	1
in	1
its	1
parts	1
ebbs	1
and	1
flows	1
as	1
one	1
local	1
influence	1
or	1
another	1
plays	1
upon	1
it."	1
There	1
are	1
temporary	1
and	1
local	1
changes,	1
endless	1
disturbances	1
and	1
readjustments	1
of	1
the	1
"balance	1
of	1
nature."	1
One	1
year	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
plague	1
of	1
field-voles,	1
perhaps	1
next	1
year	1
"grouse	1
disease"	1
is	1
rife;	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
there	1
is	1
huge	1
increase	1
of	1
starlings,	1
in	1
another	1
place	1
of	1
rabbits;	1
here	1
cockchafers	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
ascendant,	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
moles	1
are	1
spoiling	1
the	1
pasture.	1
"But	1
while	1
the	1
parts	1
fluctuate,	1
the	1
fauna	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
follows	1
a	1
path	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
As	1
well	1
as	1
internal	1
tides	1
which	1
swing	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
about	1
an	1
average	1
level,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
drift	1
which	1
carries	1
the	1
fauna	1
bodily	1
along	1
an	1
'irretraceable	1
course.'"	1
This	1
is	1
partly	1
due	1
to	1
considerable	1
changes	1
of	1
climate,	1
for	1
climate	1
calls	1
the	1
tune	1
to	1
which	1
living	1
creatures	1
dance,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
due	1
to	1
new	1
departures	1
among	1
the	1
animals	1
themselves.	1
We	1
need	1
not	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
extinct	1
animals	1
and	1
lost	1
faunas	1
of	1
past	1
ages--for	1
Britain	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
relics	1
of	1
these--which	1
"illustrate	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
the	1
faunal	1
drift,"	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
useful,	1
in	1
illustration	1
of	1
evolution	1
in	1
being,	1
to	1
notice	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
in	1
Scotland	1
since	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Ice	1
Age.	1
Some	1
nine	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago	1
or	1
more,	1
certain	1
long-headed,	1
square-jawed,	1
short-limbed,	1
but	1
agile	1
hunters	1
and	1
fishermen,	1
whom	1
we	1
call	1
Neolithic	1
Man,	1
established	1
themselves	1
in	1
Scotland.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
then?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
of	1
swamps,	1
low	1
forests	1
of	1
birch,	1
alder,	1
and	1
willow,	1
fertile	1
meadows,	1
and	1
snow-capped	1
mountains.	1
Its	1
estuaries	1
penetrated	1
further	1
inland	1
than	1
they	1
now	1
do,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
Fifty-Foot	1
Beach.	1
On	1
its	1
plains	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
forests	1
roamed	1
many	1
creatures	1
which	1
are	1
strange	1
to	1
the	1
fauna	1
of	1
to-day--the	1
Elk	1
and	1
the	1
Reindeer,	1
Wild	1
Cattle,	1
the	1
Wild	1
Boar	1
and	1
perhaps	1
Wild	1
Horses,	1
a	1
fauna	1
of	1
large	1
animals	1
which	1
paid	1
toll	1
to	1
the	1
European	1
Lynx,	1
the	1
Brown	1
Bear	1
and	1
the	1
Wolf.	1
In	1
all	1
likelihood,	1
the	1
marshes	1
resounded	1
to	1
the	1
boom	1
of	1
the	1
Bittern	1
and	1
the	1
plains	1
to	1
the	1
breeding	1
calls	1
of	1
the	1
Crane	1
and	1
the	1
Great	1
Bustard.	1
Such	1
is	1
Dr.	1
Ritchie's	1
initial	1
picture.	1

Now	1
what	1
happened	1
in	1
this	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Caledonia	1
which	1
Neolithic	1
Man	1
had	1
found?	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
introduce	1
domesticated	1
animals,	1
and	1
that	1
meant	1
a	1
thinning	1
of	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
predacious	1
creatures.	1
"Safety	1
first"	1
was	1
the	1
dangerous	1
motto	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
which	1
man	1
exterminated	1
the	1
lynx,	1
the	1
brown	1
bear,	1
and	1
the	1
wolf.	1
Other	1
creatures,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
auk,	1
were	1
destroyed	1
for	1
food,	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
the	1
marten	1
for	1
their	1
furs.	1
Small	1
pests	1
were	1
destroyed	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
agriculture;	1
larger	1
animals	1
like	1
the	1
boar	1
were	1
hunted	1
out	1
of	1
existence;	1
others,	1
like	1
the	1
pearl-bearing	1
river-mussels,	1
yielded	1
to	1
subtler	1
demands.	1
No	1
doubt	1
there	1
was	1
protection	1
also--protection	1
for	1
sport,	1
for	1
utility,	1
for	1
æhetic	1
reasons,	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
humane	1
sentiments;	1
even	1
wholesome	1
superstitions	1
have	1
safeguarded	1
the	1
robin	1
redbreast	1
and	1
the	1
wren.	1
There	1
were	1
introductions	1
too--the	1
rabbit	1
for	1
utility,	1
the	1
pheasant	1
for	1
sport,	1
and	1
the	1
peacock	1
for	1
amenity.	1
And	1
every	1
introduction,	1
every	1
protection,	1
every	1
killing	1
out	1
had	1
its	1
far-reaching	1
influences.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
picture	1
the	1
evolution	1
going	1
on,	1
we	1
must	1
think	1
also	1
of	1
man's	1
indirect	1
interference	1
with	1
animal	1
life.	1
He	1
destroyed	1
the	1
forests,	1
he	1
cultivated	1
the	1
wild,	1
he	1
made	1
bridges,	1
he	1
allowed	1
aliens,	1
like	1
rats	1
and	1
cockroaches,	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
unawares.	1
Of	1
course,	1
he	1
often	1
did	1
good,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
drained	1
swamps	1
and	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
mosquitoes	1
which	1
once	1
made	1
malaria	1
rife	1
in	1
Scotland.	1
What	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
net	1
result?	1
Not,	1
as	1
one	1
might	1
think	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
a	1
reduction	1
in	1
the	1
_number_	1
of	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
animals.	1
Fourteen	1
or	1
so	1
species	1
of	1
birds	1
and	1
beasts	1
have	1
been	1
banished	1
from	1
Scotland	1
since	1
man	1
interfered,	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
numbers	1
go	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
replaced	1
by	1
deliberate	1
introductions	1
like	1
fallow	1
deer,	1
rabbit,	1
squirrel,	1
and	1
pheasant,	1
and	1
by	1
accidental	1
introductions	1
like	1
rats	1
and	1
cockroaches.	1
But	1
the	1
change	1
is	1
rather	1
in	1
_quality_	1
than	1
in	1
quantity;	1
the	1
smaller	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
larger,	1
rather	1
paltry	1
pigmies	1
of	1
noble	1
giants.	1
Thus	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
vivid	1
idea	1
that	1
evolution,	1
especially	1
when	1
man	1
interferes,	1
is	1
not	1
necessarily	1
progressive.	1
That	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
sieves	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
living	1
materials	1
are	1
sifted.	1
As	1
Dr.	1
Ritchie	1
well	1
says,	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
the	1
wild	1
fauna	1
as	1
regards	1
size	1
has	1
fallen	1
and	1
is	1
falling,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
size	1
only	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
loss,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
deterioration	1
of	1
quality.	1
"For	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
Rabbits	1
and	1
Sparrows	1
and	1
Earthworms	1
and	1
Caterpillars,	1
and	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
Rats	1
and	1
Cochroaches	1
and	1
Crickets	1
and	1
Bugs,	1
ever	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
those	1
fine	1
creatures	1
round	1
the	1
memories	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
glamour	1
of	1
Scotland's	1
past	1
still	1
plays--the	1
Reindeer	1
and	1
the	1
Elk,	1
the	1
Wolf,	1
the	1
Brown	1
Bear,	1
the	1
Lynx,	1
and	1
the	1
Beaver,	1
the	1
Bustard,	1
the	1
Crane,	1
the	1
Bumbling	1
Bittern,	1
and	1
many	1
another,	1
lost	1
or	1
disappearing."	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
again	1
that	1
evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on.	1
§	1
3	1
The	1
Adventurers	1
All	1
through	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
during	1
which	1
animals	1
have	1
tenanted	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
waters	1
under	1
the	1
earth,	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
search	1
for	1
new	1
kingdoms	1
to	1
conquer,	1
for	1
new	1
corners	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
home.	1
And	1
this	1
still	1
goes	1
on.	1
_It	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
methods	1
of	1
evolution	1
to	1
fill	1
every	1
niche	1
of	1
opportunity._	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
spider	1
that	1
lives	1
inside	1
a	1
pitcher-plant,	1
catching	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
insects	1
which	1
slip	1
down	1
the	1
treacherous	1
internal	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
trap.	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
that	1
makes	1
its	1
home	1
in	1
crevices	1
among	1
the	1
rocks	1
on	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
Mediterranean,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
empty	1
tubular	1
shells,	1
keeping	1
the	1
water	1
out,	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
successfully,	1
by	1
spinning	1
threads	1
of	1
silk	1
across	1
the	1
entrance	1
to	1
its	1
retreat.	1
The	1
beautiful	1
brine-shrimp,	1
_Artemia	1
salina_,	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
occur	1
in	1
British	1
salterns	1
has	1
found	1
a	1
home	1
in	1
the	1
dense	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Salt	1
Lake	1
of	1
Utah.	1
Several	1
kinds	1
of	1
earthworms	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
up	1
trees,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fish,	1
Arges,	1
that	1
climbs	1
on	1
the	1
stones	1
of	1
steep	1
mountain	1
torrents	1
of	1
the	1
Andes.	1
The	1
intrepid	1
explorers	1
of	1
the	1
_Scotia_	1
voyage	1
found	1
quite	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
Arctic	1
terns	1
spending	1
our	1
winter	1
within	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
the	1
Antarctic	1
Circle--which	1
means	1
girdling	1
the	1
globe	1
from	1
pole	1
to	1
pole;	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
are	1
incursions	1
of	1
rare	1
birds,	1
like	1
Pallas's	1
Sand-grouse,	1
into	1
Britain,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
prospecting	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
a	1
promised	1
land.	1
Twice	1
or	1
thrice	1
the	1
distinctively	1
North	1
American	1
Killdeer	1
Plover	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
Britain,	1
having	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
got	1
across	1
the	1
Atlantic.	1
We	1
miss	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
evolution	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
catch	1
this	1
note	1
of	1
insurgence	1
and	1
adventure,	1
which	1
some	1
animal	1
or	1
other	1
never	1
ceases	1
to	1
sound,	1
though	1
many	1
establish	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
security	1
not	1
easily	1
disturbed,	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
small	1
minority	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
stream	1
and	1
are	1
content	1
to	1
acquiesce,	1
as	1
parasites	1
or	1
rottenness	1
eaters,	1
in	1
a	1
drifting	1
life	1
of	1
ease.	1
More	1
important	1
than	1
very	1
peculiar	1
cases	1
is	1
the	1
broad	1
fact	1
that	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
in	1
different	1
groups	1
of	1
animals	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
attempts	1
to	1
master	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
haunts--such	1
as	1
the	1
underground	1
world,	1
the	1
trees,	1
the	1
freshwaters,	1
and	1
the	1
air.	1
There	1
are	1
burrowing	1
amphibians,	1
burrowing	1
reptiles,	1
burrowing	1
birds,	1
and	1
burrowing	1
mammals;	1
there	1
are	1
tree-toads,	1
tree-snakes,	1
tree-lizards,	1
tree-kangaroos,	1
tree-sloths,	1
tree-shrews,	1
tree-mice,	1
tree-porcupines,	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
enough	1
of	1
a	1
list	1
to	1
show,	1
without	1
mentioning	1
birds,	1
how	1
many	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
animals	1
have	1
entered	1
upon	1
an	1
arboreal	1
apprenticeship--an	1
apprenticeship	1
often	1
with	1
far-reaching	1
consequences.	1
What	1
the	1
freeing	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
from	1
being	1
an	1
organ	1
of	1
terrestrial	1
support	1
has	1
meant	1
in	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
monkeys	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
that	1
gives	1
a	1
spur	1
to	1
our	1
imagination.	1
The	1
Case	1
of	1
the	1
Robber	1
Crab	1
On	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
coral	1
islands	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
and	1
Pacific	1
Oceans	1
there	1
lives	1
a	1
land-crab,	1
Birgus,	1
which	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
breathe	1
on	1
land.	1
It	1
breathes	1
dry	1
air	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
curious	1
blood-containing	1
tufts	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
gill-cavity,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
also	1
rudimentary	1
gills.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
about	1
a	1
foot	1
long,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
very	1
heavy	1
great	1
claws,	1
especially	1
on	1
the	1
left-hand	1
side.	1
With	1
this	1
great	1
claw	1
it	1
hammers	1
on	1
the	1
"eye-hole"	1
of	1
a	1
coconut,	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
torn	1
off	1
the	1
fibrous	1
husk.	1
It	1
hammers	1
until	1
a	1
hole	1
is	1
made	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
can	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
pulp.	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
shell	1
is	1
sometimes	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
protection	1
for	1
the	1
soft	1
abdomen--for	1
the	1
robber-crab,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
is	1
an	1
offshoot	1
from	1
the	1
hermit-crab	1
stock.	1
Every	1
year	1
this	1
quaint	1
explorer,	1
which	1
may	1
go	1
far	1
up	1
the	1
hills	1
and	1
climb	1
the	1
coco-palms,	1
has	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
spawn.	1
The	1
young	1
ones	1
are	1
hatched	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
as	1
in	1
our	1
common	1
shore-crab.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
they	1
are	1
free-swimming	1
larvæhich	1
pass	1
through	1
an	1
open-water	1
period	1
before	1
they	1
settle	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
eventually	1
creep	1
up	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land.	1
Just	1
as	1
open-water	1
turtles	1
lay	1
their	1
eggs	1
on	1
sandy	1
shores,	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
old	1
terrestrial	1
haunt,	1
so	1
the	1
robber-crab,	1
which	1
has	1
almost	1
conquered	1
the	1
dry	1
land,	1
has	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
seashore	1
to	1
breed.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
association	1
of	1
the	1
robber-crab	1
with	1
the	1
coco-palm,	1
for	1
that	1
tree	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
these	1
coral	1
islands,	1
but	1
has	1
been	1
introduced,	1
perhaps	1
from	1
Mexico,	1
by	1
the	1
Polynesian	1
mariners	1
before	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
America	1
by	1
Columbus.	1
So	1
the	1
learning	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
coconuts	1
is	1
a	1
recent	1
achievement,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
example	1
of	1
evolution	1
going	1
on.	1

The	1
Story	1
of	1
the	1
Salmon	1
In	1
late	1
autumn	1
or	1
in	1
winter	1
the	1
salmon	1
spawn	1
in	1
the	1
rivers.	1
The	1
female	1
makes	1
a	1
shallow	1
trough	1
in	1
the	1
gravel	1
by	1
moving	1
her	1
tail	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
and	1
therein	1
lays	1
many	1
eggs.	1
The	1
male,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
attendance,	1
fertilises	1
these	1
with	1
the	1
milt,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
female	1
covers	1
them	1
deeply	1
with	1
gravel.	1
The	1
process	1
is	1
repeated	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
more	1
till	1
all	1
the	1
eggs	1
are	1
shed.	1
For	1
three	1
to	1
four	1
months	1
the	1
eggs	1
develop,	1
and	1
eventually	1
there	1
emerge	1
the	1
larvær	1
_alevins_,	1
which	1
lurk	1
among	1
the	1
pebbles.	1
They	1
cannot	1
swim	1
much,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
encumbered	1
by	1
a	1
big	1
legacy	1
of	1
yolk.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
perhaps	1
eight,	1
the	1
protruding	1
bag	1
of	1
yolk	1
has	1
disappeared	1
and	1
the	1
_fry_,	1
about	1
an	1
inch	1
long,	1
begin	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
more	1
actively	1
and	1
to	1
fend	1
for	1
themselves.	1
By	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
they	1
have	1
grown	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
trout-like	1
_parr_,	1
about	1
four	1
inches	1
long.	1
In	1
two	1
years	1
these	1
are	1
double	1
that	1
length.	1
Usually	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
year,	1
but	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
earlier	1
or	1
later,	1
the	1
parr	1
become	1
silvery	1
_smolts_,	1
which	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
usually	1
about	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
May.	1
They	1
feed	1
on	1
young	1
herring	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
and	1
grow	1
large	1
and	1
strong.	1
When	1
they	1
are	1
about	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
years	1
old	1
they	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
rivers	1
as	1
_grilse_	1
and	1
may	1
spawn.	1
Or	1
they	1
may	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
grilse	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
and	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
rivers	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
full-grown	1
fish.	1
In	1
many	1
cases	1
the	1
salmon	1
spawn	1
only	1
once,	1
and	1
some	1
(they	1
are	1
called	1
_kelts_	1
after	1
spawning)	1
are	1
so	1
much	1
exhausted	1
by	1
starting	1
a	1
new	1
generation	1
that	1
they	1
die	1
or	1
fall	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
otters	1
and	1
other	1
enemies.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
salmon	1
of	1
the	1
North	1
Pacific	1
(in	1
the	1
genus	1
_Oncorhynchus_,	1
not	1
_Salmo_)	1
all	1
the	1
individuals	1
die	1
after	1
spawning,	1
none	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
full-grown	1
salmon	1
do	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
rule	1
feed	1
in	1
fresh	1
water,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
snapping	1
at	1
the	1
angler's	1
strange	1
creations.	1
A	1
very	1
interesting	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
salmon	1
keeps	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
diary	1
of	1
its	1
movements,	1
which	1
vary	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
different	1
rivers.	1
This	1
diary	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
scales,	1
and	1
a	1
careful	1
reading	1
of	1
the	1
concentric	1
lines	1
on	1
the	1
scales	1
shows	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
fish,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
has	1
spawned	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
more	1
besides.	1
Interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
Salmon's	1
Story	1
When	1
an	1
animal	1
frequents	1
two	1
different	1
haunts,	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
breeds,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
safe	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
breeding-place	1
represents	1
the	1
original	1
home.	1
The	1
flounder	1
is	1
quite	1
comfortable	1
far	1
up	1
the	1
rivers,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
shore-waters	1
to	1
spawn,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
flounder	1
is	1
a	1
marine	1
fish	1
which	1
has	1
recently	1
learned	1
to	1
colonise	1
the	1
fresh	1
waters.	1
Its	1
relatives,	1
like	1
plaice	1
and	1
sole,	1
are	1
strictly	1
marine.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
dogma	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
that	1
the	1
breeding-place	1
corresponds	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
home.	1
Thus	1
some	1
kinds	1
of	1
bass,	1
which	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
marine	1
family	1
of	1
sea-perches,	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
or	1
in	1
estuaries,	1
while	1
two	1
have	1
become	1
permanent	1
residents	1
in	1
fresh	1
water.	1
Or,	1
again,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
herring	1
family	1
are	1
very	1
distinctively	1
marine,	1
but	1
the	1
shad,	1
which	1
belong	1
to	1
this	1
family,	1
spawn	1
in	1
rivers	1
and	1
may	1
spend	1
their	1
lives	1
there.	1
So	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
different	1
ways	1
of	1
interpreting	1
the	1
life-history	1
of	1
the	1
salmon.	1
Some	1
authorities	1
regard	1
the	1
salmon	1
as	1
a	1
marine	1
fish	1
which	1
is	1
establishing	1
itself	1
in	1
fresh	1
water.	1
But	1
others	1
read	1
the	1
story	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
and	1
regard	1
the	1
salmon	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
a	1
freshwater	1
race,	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
for	1
feeding	1
purposes.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
trout,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
ranks	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
rivers	1
and	1
lakes	1
are	1
continually	1
being	1
reinforced	1
by	1
migrants	1
from	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
trout	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
while	1
others	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
freshwater.	1
We	1
know	1
also	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
a	1
related	1
fish,	1
the	1
char,	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
kinds	1
are	1
now	1
permanent	1
residents	1
in	1
cold	1
and	1
deep,	1
isolated	1
northern	1
lakes,	1
there	1
are	1
Arctic	1
forms	1
which	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
but	1
enter	1
the	1
rivers	1
to	1
spawn.	1
These	1
facts	1
favour	1
the	1
view	1
that	1
the	1
salmon	1
was	1
originally	1
a	1
marine	1
fish.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
arguments	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and,	1
for	1
our	1
present	1
purpose,	1
the	1
important	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
salmon	1
is	1
conquering	1
_two_	1
haunts.	1
Its	1
evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on.	1
The	1
Romance	1
of	1
the	1
Eel	1
Early	1
in	1
summer,	1
at	1
dates	1
varying	1
with	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
rivers	1
from	1
the	1
open	1
Atlantic,	1
crowds	1
of	1
young	1
eels	1
or	1
elvers	1
come	1
up-stream.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
procession	1
or	1
eel-fare	1
includes	1
thousands	1
of	1
individuals,	1
each	1
about	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
finger,	1
and	1
as	1
thick	1
as	1
a	1
stout	1
knitting	1
needle.	1
They	1
obey	1
an	1
inborn	1
impulse	1
to	1
swim	1
against	1
the	1
stream,	1
seeking	1
automatically	1
to	1
have	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
their	1
body	1
equally	1
stimulated	1
by	1
the	1
current.	1
So	1
they	1
go	1
straight	1
ahead.	1
The	1
obligation	1
works	1
only	1
during	1
the	1
day,	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
goes	1
down	1
behind	1
the	1
hills	1
the	1
elvers	1
snuggle	1
under	1
stones	1
or	1
beneath	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
rest	1
till	1
dawn.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
they	1
reach	1
the	1
quiet	1
upper	1
reaches	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
or	1
go	1
up	1
rivulets	1
and	1
drainpipes	1
to	1
the	1
isolated	1
ponds.	1
Their	1
impulse	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
imperious,	1
for	1
they	1
may	1
wriggle	1
up	1
the	1
wet	1
moss	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
waterfall	1
or	1
even	1
make	1
a	1
short	1
excursion	1
in	1
a	1
damp	1
meadow.	1
In	1
the	1
quiet-flowing	1
stretches	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
ponds	1
they	1
feed	1
and	1
grow	1
for	1
years	1
and	1
years.	1
They	1
account	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
young	1
fishes.	1
Eventually,	1
after	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
males,	1
six	1
to	1
eight	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
females,	1
the	1
well-grown	1
fishes,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
foot	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
to	1
two	1
feet	1
long,	1
are	1
seized	1
by	1
a	1
novel	1
restlessness.	1
They	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
be	1
mature.	1
They	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
silvery	1
jacket	1
and	1
become	1
large	1
of	1
eye,	1
and	1
they	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
In	1
getting	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
pond	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
wriggle	1
through	1
the	1
damp	1
meadow-grass	1
before	1
reaching	1
the	1
river.	1
They	1
travel	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
rather	1
excitedly.	1
The	1
Arctic	1
Ocean	1
is	1
too	1
cold	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
North	1
Sea	1
too	1
shallow.	1
They	1
must	1
go	1
far	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
old	1
margin	1
of	1
the	1
once	1
larger	1
continent	1
of	1
Europe	1
slopes	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
abysses,	1
from	1
the	1
Hebrides	1
southwards.	1
Eels	1
seem	1
to	1
spawn	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
dark	1
water;	1
but	1
the	1
just	1
liberated	1
eggs	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
found.	1
The	1
young	1
fry	1
rises	1
to	1
near	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
becomes	1
a	1
knife-blade-like	1
larva,	1
transparent	1
all	1
but	1
its	1
eye.	1
It	1
lives	1
for	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
this	1
state,	1
growing	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
three	1
inches	1
long,	1
rising	1
and	1
sinking	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
swimming	1
gently.	1
These	1
open-sea	1
young	1
eels	1
are	1
known	1
as	1
Leptocephali,	1
a	1
name	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
before	1
their	1
real	1
nature	1
was	1
proved.	1
They	1
gradually	1
become	1
shorter,	1
and	1
the	1
shape	1
changes	1
from	1
knife-blade-like	1
to	1
cylindrical.	1
During	1
this	1
change	1
they	1
fast,	1
and	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
their	1
delicate	1
body	1
decreases.	1
They	1
turn	1
into	1
glass-eels,	1
about	1
2-1/2	1
inches	1
long,	1
like	1
a	1
knitting-needle	1
in	1
girth.	1
They	1
begin	1
to	1
move	1
towards	1
the	1
distant	1
shores	1
and	1
rivers,	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
old	1
before	1
they	1
reach	1
their	1
destination	1
and	1
go	1
up-stream	1
as	1
elvers.	1
Those	1
that	1
ascend	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
the	1
Eastern	1
Baltic	1
must	1
have	1
journeyed	1
three	1
thousand	1
miles.	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
no	1
eel	1
ever	1
matures	1
or	1
spawns	1
in	1
fresh	1
water.	1
It	1
is	1
practically	1
certain	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
eels	1
ascending	1
the	1
rivers	1
of	1
North	1
Europe	1
have	1
come	1
in	1
from	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
perhaps	1
from	1
the	1
Azores	1
or	1
further	1
out	1
still.	1
It	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
the	1
young	1
eels	1
circumvent	1
the	1
Falls	1
of	1
the	1
Rhine	1
and	1
get	1
into	1
Lake	1
Constance,	1
or	1
how	1
their	1
kindred	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
overcome	1
the	1
obstacle	1
of	1
Niagara;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
important	1
to	1
lay	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
habitats	1
which	1
this	1
fish	1
is	1
trying--the	1
deep	1
waters,	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
the	1
shore,	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
pond,	1
and	1
even,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
a	1
little	1
taste	1
of	1
solid	1
earth.	1
It	1
seems	1
highly	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
common	1
eel	1
is	1
a	1
deep-water	1
marine	1
fish	1
which	1
has	1
learned	1
to	1
colonise	1
the	1
freshwaters.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
adventurous	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
succeeded.	1
The	1
only	1
shadow	1
on	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
achievement	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
spawning.	1
There	1
is	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
death	1
is	1
the	1
nemesis	1
of	1
their	1
reproduction.	1
In	1
any	1
case,	1
no	1
adult	1
eel	1
ever	1
comes	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
deep	1
sea.	1
We	1
are	1
minded	1
of	1
Goethe's	1
hard	1
saying:	1
"Death	1
is	1
Nature's	1
expert	1
advice	1
to	1
get	1
plenty	1
of	1
life."	1
§	1

Forming	1
New	1
Habits	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
well-known	1
mudfish	1
of	1
Australia,	1
Neoceratodus	1
by	1
name,	1
which	1
has	1
turned	1
its	1
swim-bladder	1
into	1
a	1
lung	1
and	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
to	1
spout.	1
It	1
expels	1
vitiated	1
air	1
with	1
considerable	1
force	1
and	1
takes	1
fresh	1
gulps.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
like	1
an	1
ordinary	1
fish,	1
it	1
has	1
gills	1
which	1
allow	1
the	1
usual	1
interchange	1
of	1
gases	1
between	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
water.	1
Now	1
this	1
Australian	1
mudfish	1
or	1
double-breather	1
(Dipnoan),	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
over	1
a	1
yard	1
in	1
length,	1
is	1
a	1
direct	1
and	1
little-changed	1
descendant	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
extinct	1
fish,	1
Ceratodus,	1
which	1
lived	1
in	1
Mesozoic	1
times,	1
as	1
far	1
back	1
as	1
the	1
Jurassic,	1
which	1
probably	1
means	1
over	1
five	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
ago.	1
The	1
Queensland	1
mudfish	1
is	1
an	1
antiquity,	1
and	1
there	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
much	1
change	1
in	1
its	1
lineage	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years.	1
We	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
inertia	1
of	1
evolution.	1
And	1
yet,	1
though	1
its	1
structure	1
has	1
changed	1
but	1
little,	1
the	1
fish	1
probably	1
illustrates	1
evolution	1
in	1
process,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fish	1
that	1
is	1
learning	1
to	1
breathe	1
dry	1
air.	1
It	1
cannot	1
leave	1
the	1
water;	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
live	1
comfortably	1
in	1
pools	1
which	1
are	1
foul	1
with	1
decomposing	1
animal	1
and	1
vegetable	1
matter.	1
In	1
partially	1
dried-up	1
and	1
foul	1
waterholes,	1
full	1
of	1
dead	1
fishes	1
of	1
various	1
kinds,	1
Neoceratodus	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
vigorous	1
and	1
lively.	1
Unless	1
we	1
take	1
the	1
view,	1
which	1
is	1
_possible_,	1
that	1
the	1
swim-bladder	1
of	1
fishes	1
was	1
originally	1
a	1
lung,	1
the	1
mud-fishes	1
are	1
learning	1
to	1
breathe	1
dry	1
air.	1
They	1
illustrate	1
evolution	1
agoing.	1

THE	1
KIWI,	1
ANOTHER	1
FLIGHTLESS	1
BIRD,	1
OF	1
REMARKABLE	1
APPEARANCE,	1
HABITS,	1
AND	1
STRUCTURE]	1
The	1
herring-gull	1
is	1
by	1
nature	1
a	1
fish-eater;	1
but	1
of	1
recent	1
years,	1
in	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
Britain,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
becoming	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
months	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
vegetarian,	1
scooping	1
out	1
the	1
turnips,	1
devouring	1
potatoes,	1
settling	1
on	1
the	1
sheaves	1
in	1
the	1
harvest	1
field	1
and	1
gorging	1
itself	1
with	1
grain.	1
Similar	1
experiments,	1
usually	1
less	1
striking,	1
are	1
known	1
in	1
many	1
birds;	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
signal	1
illustration	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
kea	1
or	1
Nestor	1
parrot	1
of	1
New	1
Zealand,	1
which	1
has	1
taken	1
to	1
lighting	1
on	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
the	1
sheep,	1
tearing	1
away	1
the	1
fleece,	1
cutting	1
at	1
the	1
skin,	1
and	1
gouging	1
out	1
fat.	1
Now	1
the	1
parrot	1
belongs	1
to	1
a	1
vegetarian	1
or	1
frugivorous	1
stock,	1
and	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
diet	1
in	1
the	1
relatively	1
short	1
time	1
since	1
sheep-ranches	1
were	1
established	1
in	1
New	1
Zealand	1
is	1
very	1
striking.	1
Here,	1
since	1
we	1
know	1
the	1
dates,	1
we	1
may	1
speak	1
of	1
evolution	1
going	1
on	1
under	1
our	1
eyes.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
variations	1
in	1
habit	1
may	1
give	1
an	1
animal	1
a	1
new	1
opportunity	1
to	1
test	1
variations	1
in	1
structure	1
which	1
arise	1
mysteriously	1
from	1
within,	1
as	1
expressions	1
of	1
germinal	1
changefulness	1
rather	1
than	1
as	1
imprints	1
from	1
without.	1
For	1
of	1
the	1
transmissibility	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
secure	1
evidence.	1
Experiments	1
in	1
Locomotion	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
interesting	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
types	1
of	1
locomotion	1
which	1
animals	1
have	1
discovered--pulling	1
and	1
punting,	1
sculling	1
and	1
rowing,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
changes	1
that	1
are	1
rung	1
on	1
these	1
four	1
main	1
methods.	1
How	1
striking	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
frilled	1
lizard	1
(Chlamydosaurus)	1
of	1
Australia,	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
time	1
is,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
experimenting	1
in	1
bipedal	1
progression--always	1
a	1
rather	1
eventful	1
thing	1
to	1
do.	1
It	1
gets	1
up	1
on	1
its	1
hind-legs	1
and	1
runs	1
totteringly	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
feet,	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
baby	1
learning	1
to	1
walk.	1
How	1
beautiful	1
is	1
the	1
adventure	1
which	1
has	1
led	1
our	1
dipper	1
or	1
water-ouzel--a	1
bird	1
allied	1
to	1
the	1
wrens--to	1
try	1
walking	1
and	1
flying	1
under	1
water!	1
How	1
admirable	1
is	1
the	1
volplaning	1
of	1
numerous	1
parachutists--"flying	1
fish,"	1
"flying	1
frog,"	1
"flying	1
dragon,"	1
"flying	1
phalanger,"	1
"flying	1
squirrel,"	1
and	1
more	1
besides,	1
which	1
take	1
great	1
leaps	1
through	1
the	1
air.	1
For	1
are	1
these	1
not	1
the	1
splendid	1
failures	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
starting	1
new	1
modes	1
of	1
flight?	1
Most	1
daring	1
of	1
all,	1
perhaps,	1
are	1
the	1
aerial	1
journeys	1
undertaken	1
by	1
many	1
small	1
spiders.	1
On	1
a	1
breezy	1
morning,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
autumn,	1
they	1
mount	1
on	1
gate-posts	1
and	1
palings	1
and	1
herbage,	1
and,	1
standing	1
with	1
their	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
wind,	1
pay	1
out	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
long	1
threads	1
of	1
silk.	1
When	1
the	1
wind	1
tugs	1
at	1
these	1
threads,	1
the	1
spinners	1
let	1
go,	1
and	1
are	1
borne,	1
usually	1
back	1
downwards,	1
on	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
wind	1
from	1
one	1
parish	1
to	1
another.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
wind	1
falls	1
they	1
can	1
unfurl	1
more	1
sail,	1
or	1
furl	1
if	1
it	1
rises.	1
In	1
any	1
case,	1
these	1
wingless	1
creatures	1
make	1
aerial	1
journeys.	1
When	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
used	1
threads	1
sink	1
to	1
earth,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
"shower	1
of	1
gossamer."	1
On	1
his	1
_Beagle_	1
voyage	1
Darwin	1
observed	1
that	1
vast	1
numbers	1
of	1
small	1
gossamer	1
spiders	1
were	1
borne	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
ship	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
sixty	1
miles	1
distant	1
from	1
the	1
land.	1

It	1
is	1
impossible,	1
we	1
must	1
admit,	1
to	1
fix	1
dates,	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
cases,	1
relatively	1
recent;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
smack	1
of	1
modernity	1
in	1
some	1
striking	1
devices	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
observe	1
in	1
operation	1
to-day.	1
Thus	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
dispute	1
the	1
statement	1
that	1
spiders	1
are	1
thoroughly	1
terrestrial	1
animals	1
breathing	1
dry	1
air,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
water-spider	1
conquering	1
the	1
under-water	1
world.	1
There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
spiders	1
about	1
the	1
seashore,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
that	1
can	1
survive	1
douching	1
with	1
freshwater,	1
but	1
the	1
particular	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
water-spider,	1
_Argyroneta	1
natans_,	1
stands	1
by	1
itself	1
because	1
the	1
creature,	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
female	1
at	1
least,	1
has	1
_conquered_	1
the	1
sub-aquatic	1
environment.	1
A	1
flattish	1
web	1
is	1
woven,	1
somehow,	1
underneath	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
pegged	1
down	1
by	1
threads	1
of	1
silk.	1
Along	1
a	1
special	1
vertical	1
line	1
the	1
mother	1
spider	1
ascends	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
descends	1
again,	1
having	1
entangled	1
air	1
in	1
the	1
hairs	1
of	1
her	1
body.	1
She	1
brushes	1
off	1
this	1
air	1
underneath	1
her	1
web,	1
which	1
is	1
thereby	1
buoyed	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dome.	1
She	1
does	1
this	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again,	1
never	1
getting	1
wet	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
until	1
the	1
domed	1
web	1
has	1
become	1
like	1
a	1
diving-bell,	1
full	1
of	1
dry	1
air.	1
In	1
this	1
eloquent	1
anticipation	1
of	1
man's	1
rational	1
device,	1
this	1
creature--far	1
from	1
being	1
endowed	1
with	1
reason--lays	1
her	1
eggs	1
and	1
looks	1
after	1
her	1
young.	1
The	1
general	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
is	1
that	1
when	1
competition	1
is	1
keen,	1
a	1
new	1
area	1
of	1
exploitation	1
is	1
a	1
promised	1
land.	1
Thus	1
spiders	1
have	1
spread	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
earth	1
except	1
the	1
polar	1
areas.	1
But	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
spider	1
with	1
some	1
spirit	1
of	1
adventure,	1
which	1
has	1
endeavoured,	1
instead	1
of	1
trekking,	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
new	1
corner	1
near	1
at	1
home.	1
It	1
has	1
tackled	1
a	1
problem	1
surely	1
difficult	1
for	1
a	1
terrestrial	1
animal,	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
great	1
part	1
under	1
water,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
solved	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
at	1
once	1
effective	1
and	1
beautiful.	1
In	1
Conclusion	1
We	1
have	1
given	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
representative	1
illustrations	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
theme.	1
When	1
we	1
consider	1
the	1
changefulness	1
of	1
living	1
creatures,	1
the	1
transformations	1
of	1
cultivated	1
plants	1
and	1
domesticated	1
animals,	1
the	1
gradual	1
alterations	1
in	1
the	1
fauna	1
of	1
a	1
country,	1
the	1
search	1
after	1
new	1
haunts,	1
the	1
forming	1
of	1
new	1
habits,	1
and	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
many	1
inventions,	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
convinced	1
that	1
Evolution	1
is	1
going	1
on?	1
And	1
why	1
should	1
it	1
stop?	1

MIND	1
THE	1
DAWN	1
OF	1
MIND	1
In	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
evolution	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
chapter	1
more	1
interesting	1
than	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
the	1
animal	1
kingdom.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
difficult	1
chapter	1
to	1
read,	1
partly	1
because	1
"mind"	1
cannot	1
be	1
seen	1
or	1
measured,	1
only	1
_inferred_	1
from	1
the	1
outward	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
creature,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
almost	1
impossible	1
to	1
avoid	1
reading	1
ourselves	1
into	1
the	1
much	1
simpler	1
animals.	1
§	1
1	1
Two	1
Extremes	1
to	1
be	1
Avoided	1
The	1
one	1
extreme	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
uncritical	1
generosity	1
which	1
credits	1
every	1
animal,	1
like	1
Brer	1
Rabbit--who,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
was	1
the	1
hare--with	1
human	1
qualities.	1
The	1
other	1
extreme	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
an	1
automatic	1
machine,	1
in	1
the	1
working	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
place	1
or	1
use	1
for	1
mind.	1
Both	1
these	1
extremes	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
avoided.	1
When	1
Professor	1
Whitman	1
took	1
the	1
eggs	1
of	1
the	1
Passenger	1
Pigeon	1
(which	1
became	1
extinct	1
not	1
long	1
ago	1
with	1
startling	1
rapidity)	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
a	1
few	1
inches	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
nest,	1
the	1
bird	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
beak	1
under	1
her	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
feel	1
for	1
something	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
But	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
retrieve	1
her	1
eggs,	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
as	1
they	1
were.	1
In	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
flew	1
away	1
altogether.	1
This	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
pigeon	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
man.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
when	1
a	1
certain	1
clever	1
dog,	1
carrying	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
eggs,	1
with	1
the	1
handle	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stile	1
which	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
negotiated,	1
he	1
laid	1
the	1
basket	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
pushed	1
it	1
gently	1
through	1
a	1
low	1
gap	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
a	1
running	1
leap	1
over.	1
We	1
dare	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
dog	1
as	1
an	1
automatic	1
machine.	1
A	1
Caution	1
in	1
Regard	1
to	1
Instinct	1
In	1
studying	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
animals,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
at	1
their	1
mind,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
direct	1
knowledge,	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
give	1
prominence	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
throughout	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
living	1
creatures	1
a	1
strong	1
tendency	1
to	1
enregister	1
or	1
engrain	1
capacities	1
of	1
doing	1
things	1
effectively.	1
Thus	1
certain	1
abilities	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
inborn;	1
they	1
are	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
inheritance,	1
which	1
will	1
express	1
themselves	1
whenever	1
the	1
appropriate	1
trigger	1
is	1
pulled.	1
The	1
newly	1
born	1
child	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
to	1
learn	1
its	1
breathing	1
movements,	1
as	1
it	1
afterwards	1
requires	1
to	1
learn	1
its	1
walking	1
movements.	1
The	1
ability	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
breathing	1
movements	1
is	1
inborn,	1
engrained,	1
enregistered.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
there	1
are	1
hereditary	1
pre-arrangements	1
of	1
nerve-cells	1
and	1
muscle-cells	1
which	1
come	1
into	1
activity	1
almost	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
the	1
beating	1
of	1
the	1
heart.	1
In	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
the	1
newborn	1
pigling	1
creeps	1
close	1
to	1
its	1
mother	1
and	1
sucks	1
milk.	1
It	1
has	1
not	1
to	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
cough	1
or	1
sneeze.	1
Thus	1
animals	1
have	1
many	1
useful	1
ready-made,	1
or	1
almost	1
ready-made,	1
capacities	1
of	1
doing	1
apparently	1
clever	1
things.	1
In	1
simple	1
cases	1
of	1
these	1
inborn	1
pre-arrangements	1
we	1
speak	1
of	1
reflex	1
actions;	1
in	1
more	1
complicated	1
cases,	1
of	1
instinctive	1
behaviour.	1
Now	1
the	1
caution	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
while	1
these	1
inborn	1
capacities	1
usually	1
work	1
well	1
in	1
natural	1
conditions,	1
they	1
sometimes	1
work	1
badly	1
when	1
the	1
ordinary	1
routine	1
is	1
disturbed.	1
We	1
see	1
this	1
when	1
a	1
pigeon	1
continues	1
sitting	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
nest,	1
or	1
when	1
it	1
fails	1
to	1
retrieve	1
its	1
eggs	1
only	1
two	1
inches	1
away.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
mistake	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
pigeon,	1
because	1
of	1
this,	1
an	1
unutterably	1
stupid	1
bird.	1
We	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
homing	1
pigeons	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
cannot	1
be	1
true.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
judge	1
animals	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
those	1
kinds	1
of	1
behaviour	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
instinct,	1
and	1
go	1
badly	1
agee	1
when	1
the	1
normal	1
routine	1
is	1
disturbed.	1
In	1
ninety-nine	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
the	1
enregistered	1
instinctive	1
capacities	1
work	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
their	1
becoming	1
stereotyped	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
animal	1
more	1
free	1
for	1
adventures	1
at	1
a	1
higher	1
level.	1
Being	1
"a	1
slave	1
of	1
instinct"	1
may	1
give	1
the	1
animal	1
a	1
security	1
that	1
enables	1
it	1
to	1
discover	1
some	1
new	1
home	1
or	1
new	1
food	1
or	1
new	1
joy.	1
Somewhat	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
methodical	1
habits,	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
himself	1
established,	1
may	1
gain	1
leisure	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
new	1
departure	1
of	1
racial	1
profit.	1

When	1
we	1
draw	1
back	1
our	1
finger	1
from	1
something	1
very	1
hot,	1
or	1
shut	1
our	1

from	1

we	1
do	1
not	1
will	1
the	1
action;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
the	1
case,	1
probably,	1
when	1
a	1
young	1
mammal	1
sucks	1
its	1
mother	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
Some	1
Mound-birds	1
of	1
Celebes	1
lay	1
their	1
eggs	1
in	1
warm	1
volcanic	1
ash	1
by	1
the	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
others	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
fermenting	1
vegetation;	1
it	1
is	1
inborn	1
in	1
the	1
newly	1
hatched	1
bird	1
to	1
struggle	1
out	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
strange	1
nest,	1
else	1
it	1
will	1
suffocate.	1
If	1
it	1
stops	1
struggling	1
too	1
soon,	1
it	1
perishes,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
the	1
trigger	1
of	1
the	1
instinct	1
cannot	1
be	1
pulled	1
twice.	1
Similarly,	1
when	1
the	1
eggs	1
of	1
the	1
turtle,	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
of	1
the	1
shore,	1
hatch	1
out,	1
the	1
young	1
ones	1
make	1
_instinctively_	1
for	1
the	1
sea.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
crocodiles	1
bury	1
their	1
eggs	1
two	1
feet	1
or	1
so	1
below	1
the	1
surface	1
among	1
sand	1
and	1
decaying	1
vegetation--an	1
awkward	1
situation	1
for	1
a	1
birthplace.	1
When	1
the	1
young	1
crocodile	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
egg-shell,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
chick	1
does	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
brooding,	1
it	1
utters	1
_instinctively_	1
a	1
piping	1
cry.	1
On	1
hearing	1
this,	1
the	1
watchful	1
mother	1
digs	1
away	1
the	1
heavy	1
blankets,	1
otherwise	1
the	1
young	1
crocodile	1
would	1
be	1
buried	1
alive	1
at	1
birth.	1
Now	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
warrant	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
Mound-birds,	1
young	1
crocodiles,	1
and	1
young	1
turtles	1
have	1
an	1
intelligent	1
appreciation	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
hatched.	1
They	1
act	1
instinctively,	1
"as	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
born."	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
their	1
activity	1
is	1
not	1
backed	1
by	1
endeavour	1
or	1
even	1
suffused	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
awareness.	1
Of	1
course,	1
it	1
is	1
necessarily	1
difficult	1
for	1
man,	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
to	1
get	1
even	1
an	1
inkling	1
of	1
the	1
mental	1
side	1
of	1
instinctive	1
behaviour.	1
In	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
reaches	1
of	1
animal	1
instinct,	1
as	1
in	1
courtship	1
or	1
nest-building,	1
in	1
hunting	1
or	1
preparing	1
the	1
food,	1
it	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
starting	1
of	1
the	1
routine	1
activity	1
also	1
"rang	1
up"	1
the	1
higher	1
centres	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
intelligence	1
on	1
the	1
_qui	1
vive_,	1
ready	1
to	1
interpose	1
when	1
needed.	1
So	1
the	1
twofold	1
caution	1
is	1
this:	1
(1)	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
depreciate	1
the	1
creature	1
too	1
much	1
if,	1
in	1
unusual	1
circumstances,	1
it	1
acts	1
in	1
an	1
ineffective	1
way	1
along	1
lines	1
of	1
behaviour	1
which	1
are	1
normally	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
instinct;	1
and	1
(2)	1
we	1
must	1
leave	1
open	1
the	1
possibility	1
that	1
even	1
routine	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
may	1
be	1
suffused	1
with	1
awareness	1
and	1
backed	1
by	1
endeavour.	1
§	1
2	1
A	1
Useful	1
Law	1
But	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
animal	1
with	1
intelligence	1
and	1
when	1
with	1
something	1
less	1
spontaneous?	1
Above	1
all,	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
know	1
when	1
the	1
effective	1
action,	1
like	1
opening	1
the	1
mouth	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
it	1
is	1
touched	1
by	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
mother's	1
beak,	1
is	1
just	1
a	1
physiological	1
action	1
like	1
coughing	1
or	1
sneezing,	1
and	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
behind	1
it--a	1
mind	1
at	1
work?	1
The	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
given	1
by	1
Prof.	1
Lloyd	1
Morgan,	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
comparative	1
psychology,	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
describe	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
behaviour	1
very	1
carefully,	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
occurred,	1
without	1
reading	1
anything	1
into	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
ascribe	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
faculty	1
if	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
satisfactorily	1
accounted	1
for	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
a	1
lower	1
one.	1
In	1
following	1
this	1
principle	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
sometimes	1
niggardly,	1
for	1
the	1
behaviour	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
mental	1
subtlety	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
missed;	1
but	1
in	1
nine	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
our	1
conclusions	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
sound.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
critical,	1
scientific	1
way.	1
Bearing	1
this	1
law	1
in	1
mind,	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
mind	1
among	1
backboned	1
animals.	1
Senses	1
of	1
Fishes	1
Fishes	1
cannot	1
shut	1
their	1
eyes,	1
having	1
no	1
true	1
lids;	1
but	1
the	1
eyes	1
themselves	1
are	1
very	1
well	1
developed	1
and	1
the	1
vision	1
is	1
acute,	1
especially	1
for	1
moving	1
objects.	1
Except	1
in	1
gristly	1
fishes,	1
the	1
external	1
opening	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
has	1
been	1
lost,	1
so	1
that	1
sound-waves	1
and	1
coarser	1
vibrations	1
must	1
influence	1
the	1
inner	1
ear,	1
which	1
is	1
well	1
developed,	1
through	1
the	1
surrounding	1
flesh	1
and	1
bones.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
the	1
main	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
ear	1
in	1
fishes	1
is	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
balancing,	1
not	1
with	1
hearing.	1
In	1
many	1
cases,	1
however,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hearing	1
has	1
been	1
demonstrated;	1
thus	1
fishes	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
pond	1
to	1
be	1
fed	1
when	1
a	1
bell	1
is	1
rung	1
or	1
when	1
a	1
whistle	1
is	1
blown	1
by	1
someone	1
not	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
fact	1
that	1
many	1
fishes	1
pay	1
no	1
attention	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
loud	1
noises	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
deaf,	1
for	1
an	1
animal	1
may	1
hear	1
a	1
sound	1
and	1
yet	1
remain	1
quite	1
indifferent	1
or	1
irresponsive.	1
This	1
merely	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
sound	1
has	1
no	1
vital	1
interest	1
for	1
the	1
animal.	1
Some	1
fishes,	1
such	1
as	1
bullhead	1
and	1
dogfish,	1
have	1
a	1
true	1
sense	1
of	1
smell,	1
detecting	1
by	1
their	1
nostrils	1
very	1
dilute	1
substances	1
permeating	1
the	1
water	1
from	1
a	1
distance.	1
Others,	1
such	1
as	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
cod	1
family,	1
perceive	1
their	1
food	1
in	1
part	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
taste,	1
which	1
is	1
susceptible	1
to	1
substances	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
and	1
present	1
in	1
considerable	1
quantity.	1
This	1
sense	1
of	1
taste	1
may	1
be	1
located	1
on	1
the	1
fins	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
about	1
the	1
mouth.	1
At	1
this	1
low	1
level	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
smell	1
and	1
taste	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
readily	1
separated.	1
The	1
chief	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
sensitive	1
line	1
or	1
lateral	1
line	1
seen	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
bony	1
fish	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
animal	1
aware	1
of	1
slow	1
vibrations	1
and	1
changes	1
of	1
pressure	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
skin	1
responds	1
to	1
pressures,	1
the	1
ear	1
to	1
vibrations	1
of	1
high	1
frequency;	1
the	1
lateral	1
line	1
is	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
in	1
its	1
function.	1
Interesting	1
Ways	1
of	1
Fishes	1
The	1
brain	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
bony	1
fish	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
level.	1
Thus	1
the	1
cerebral	1
hemispheres,	1
destined	1
to	1
become	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
are	1
poorly	1
developed.	1
In	1
gristly	1
fishes,	1
like	1
skates	1
and	1
sharks,	1
the	1
brain	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
promising.	1
But	1
although	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
does	1
not	1
lead	1
one	1
to	1
expect	1
very	1
much	1
from	1
a	1
bony	1
fish	1
like	1
trout	1
or	1
eel,	1
haddock	1
or	1
herring,	1
illustrations	1
are	1
not	1
wanting	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
pretty	1
pieces	1
of	1
behaviour.	1
Let	1
us	1
select	1
a	1
few	1
cases.	1
The	1
Stickleback's	1
Nest	1
The	1
three-spined	1
and	1
two-spined	1
sticklebacks	1
live	1
equally	1
well	1
in	1
fresh	1
or	1
salt	1
water;	1
the	1
larger	1
fifteen-spined	1
stickleback	1
is	1
entirely	1
marine.	1
In	1
all	1
three	1
species	1
the	1
male	1
fish	1
makes	1
a	1
nest,	1
in	1
fresh	1
or	1
brackish	1
water	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
cases,	1
in	1
shore-pools	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
case.	1
The	1
little	1
species	1
use	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
stems	1
of	1
water-plants;	1
the	1
larger	1
species	1
use	1
seaweed	1
and	1
zoophyte.	1
The	1
leaves	1
or	1
fronds	1
are	1
entangled	1
together	1
and	1
fastened	1
by	1
glue-like	1
threads,	1
secreted,	1
strange	1
to	1
say,	1
by	1
the	1
kidneys.	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
temporary	1
diseased	1
condition	1
had	1
been	1
regularised	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
good	1
purpose.	1
Going	1
through	1
the	1
nest	1
several	1
times,	1
the	1
male	1
makes	1
a	1
little	1
room	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
Partly	1
by	1
coercion	1
and	1
partly	1
by	1
coaxing	1
he	1
induces	1
a	1
female--first	1
one	1
and	1
then	1
another--to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
nest	1
with	1
two	1
doors,	1
depositing	1
eggs	1
during	1
her	1
short	1
sojourn.	1
The	1
females	1
go	1
their	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
male	1
mounts	1
guard	1
over	1
the	1
nest.	1
He	1
drives	1
off	1
intruding	1
fishes	1
much	1
bigger	1
than	1
himself.	1
When	1
the	1
young	1
are	1
hatched,	1
the	1
male	1
has	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
much	1
to	1
do,	1
keeping	1
his	1
charges	1
within	1
bounds	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
move	1
about	1
with	1
agility.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
sticklebacks	1
are	1
short-lived	1
fishes,	1
probably	1
breeding	1
only	1
once;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
reasonable	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
their	1
success	1
as	1
a	1
race	1
depends	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
on	1
the	1
paternal	1
care.	1
Now	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
nesting	1
behaviour	1
had	1
appeared	1
suddenly	1
in	1
its	1
present	1
form,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
fish	1
with	1
considerable	1
mental	1
ability.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
generous	1
if	1
we	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
routine	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
racial	1
process	1
of	1
slight	1
improvements	1
and	1
critical	1
testings.	1
The	1
secretion	1
of	1
the	1
glue	1
probably	1
came	1
about	1
as	1
a	1
pathological	1
variation;	1
its	1
utilisation	1
was	1
perhaps	1
discovered	1
by	1
accident;	1
the	1
types	1
that	1
had	1
wit	1
enough	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
were	1
most	1
successful;	1
the	1
routine	1
became	1
enregistered	1
hereditarily.	1
The	1
stickleback	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
it	1
looks.	1

The	1
Mind	1
of	1
a	1
Minnow	1
To	1
find	1
solid	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
base	1
an	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
fishes,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
experiment,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
refer	1
to	1
Miss	1
Gertrude	1
White's	1
interesting	1
work	1
on	1
American	1
minnows	1
and	1
sticklebacks.	1
After	1
the	1
fishes	1
had	1
become	1
quite	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
their	1
artificial	1
surroundings,	1
their	1
lessons	1
began.	1
Cloth	1
packets,	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
contained	1
meat	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
cotton,	1
were	1
suspended	1
at	1
opposite	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
aquarium.	1
The	1
mud-minnows	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
perceived	1
either	1
packet,	1
though	1
they	1
swam	1
close	1
by	1
them;	1
the	1
sticklebacks	1
were	1
intrigued	1
at	1
once.	1
Those	1
that	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
packet	1
containing	1
meat	1
darted	1
furiously	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
pulled	1
at	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
excitement.	1
Those	1
that	1
went	1
towards	1
the	1
cotton	1
packet	1
turned	1
sharply	1
away	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
within	1
about	1
two	1
inches	1
off.	1
They	1
then	1
perceived	1
what	1
those	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
were	1
after	1
and	1
joined	1
them--a	1
common	1
habit	1
amongst	1
fishes.	1
Although	1
the	1
minnows	1
were	1
not	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
tiny	1
"bags	1
of	1
mystery,"	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
more	1
alert	1
than	1
the	1
sticklebacks	1
in	1
perceiving	1
moving	1
objects	1
in	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
both	1
these	1
shallow-water	1
species	1
discover	1
their	1
food	1
largely	1
by	1
sense	1
of	1
sight.	1
The	1
next	1
set	1
of	1
lessons	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
colour-associations.	1
The	1
fishes	1
were	1
fed	1
on	1
minced	1
snail,	1
chopped	1
earthworm,	1
fragments	1
of	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
forceps	1
held	1
above	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
fishes	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
smell.	1
They	1
had	1
to	1
leap	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
food	1
from	1
the	1
forceps.	1
Discs	1
of	1
coloured	1
cardboard	1
were	1
slipped	1
over	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
forceps,	1
so	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
fishes	1
saw	1
was	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
food	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
a	1
coloured	1
disc.	1
After	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
preliminary	1
training,	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
well	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
coloured	1
discs	1
that	1
the	1
presentation	1
of	1
one	1
served	1
as	1
a	1
signal	1
for	1
the	1
fishes	1
to	1
dart	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
spring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
When	1
baits	1
of	1
paper	1
were	1
substituted	1
for	1
the	1
food,	1
the	1
fishes	1
continued	1
to	1
jump	1
at	1
the	1
discs.	1
When,	1
however,	1
a	1
blue	1
disc	1
was	1
persistently	1
used	1
for	1
the	1
paper	1
bait	1
and	1
a	1
red	1
disc	1
for	1
the	1
real	1
food,	1
or	1
_vice	1
versa_,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
minnows	1
learned	1
to	1
discriminate	1
infallibly	1
between	1
shadow	1
and	1
substance,	1
both	1
when	1
these	1
were	1
presented	1
alternately	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
presented	1
simultaneously.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
dawn	1
of	1
mind.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
lessons,	1
both	1
minnows	1
and	1
sticklebacks	1
learned	1
to	1
associate	1
particular	1
colours	1
with	1
food,	1
and	1
other	1
associations	1
were	1
also	1
formed.	1
A	1
kind	1
of	1
larva	1
that	1
a	1
minnow	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
after	1
repeated	1
trials	1
was	1
subsequently	1
ignored.	1
The	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
experimenter	1
or	1
anyone	1
else	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
food-signal.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
life	1
of	1
fishes	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
forming	1
useful	1
associations	1
and	1
suppressing	1
useless	1
responses.	1
Given	1
an	1
inborn	1
repertory	1
of	1
profitable	1
movements	1
that	1
require	1
no	1
training,	1
given	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
forming	1
associations	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
we	1
have	1
illustrated,	1
and	1
given	1
a	1
considerable	1
degree	1
of	1
sensory	1
alertness	1
along	1
certain	1
lines,	1
fishes	1
do	1
not	1
require	1
much	1
more.	1
And	1
in	1
truth	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
it.	1
Moving	1
with	1
great	1
freedom	1
in	1
three	1
dimensions	1
in	1
a	1
medium	1
that	1
supports	1
them	1
and	1
is	1
very	1
uniform	1
and	1
constant,	1
able	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
to	1
get	1
plenty	1
of	1
food	1
without	1
fatiguing	1
exertions	1
and	1
to	1
dispense	1
with	1
it	1
for	1
considerable	1
periods	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
scarce,	1
multiplying	1
usually	1
in	1
great	1
abundance	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
huge	1
infantile	1
mortality	1
hardly	1
counts,	1
rarely	1
dying	1
a	1
natural	1
death	1
but	1
usually	1
coming	1
with	1
their	1
strength	1
unabated	1
to	1
a	1
violent	1
end,	1
fishes	1
hold	1
their	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
without	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
mental	1
endowment.	1
Their	1
brain	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
motion	1
than	1
with	1
mentality,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
remained	1
at	1
a	1
low	1
psychical	1
level.	1
Yet	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
should	1
greatly	1
misjudge	1
our	1
own	1
race	1
if	1
we	1
confined	1
our	1
attention	1
to	1
everyday	1
routine,	1
so	1
in	1
our	1
total,	1
as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
our	1
average,	1
estimate	1
of	1
fishes,	1
we	1
must	1
remember	1
the	1
salmon	1
surmounting	1
the	1
falls,	1
the	1
wary	1
trout	1
eluding	1
the	1
angler's	1
skill,	1
the	1
common	1
mud-skipper	1
(Periophthalmus)	1
of	1
many	1
tropical	1
shores	1
which	1
climbs	1
on	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
mangrove-trees,	1
or	1
actively	1
hunts	1
small	1
shore-animals.	1
We	1
must	1
remember	1
the	1
adventurous	1
life-history	1
of	1
the	1
eel	1
and	1
the	1
quaint	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
fishes,	1
males	1
especially,	1
look	1
after	1
their	1
family.	1
The	1
male	1
sea-horse	1
puts	1
the	1
eggs	1
in	1
his	1
breast-pocket;	1
the	1
male	1
Kurtus	1
carries	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head;	1
the	1
cock-paidle	1
or	1
lumpsucker	1
guards	1
them	1
and	1
aerates	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
shore-pool.	1

The	1
Mind	1
of	1
Amphibians	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
Red	1
Sandstone	1
or	1
Devonian,	1
a	1
great	1
step	1
in	1
evolution	1
was	1
taken--the	1
emergence	1
of	1
Amphibians.	1
The	1
earliest	1
representatives	1
had	1
fish-like	1
characters	1
even	1
more	1
marked	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
discerned	1
in	1
the	1
tadpoles	1
of	1
our	1
frogs	1
and	1
toads,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
amphibians	1
sprang	1
from	1
a	1
fish	1
stock.	1
But	1
they	1
made	1
great	1
strides,	1
associated	1
in	1
part	1
with	1
their	1
attempts	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
on	1
to	1
dry	1
land.	1
From	1
fossil	1
forms	1
we	1
cannot	1
say	1
much	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
soft	1
parts;	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
consider	1
the	1
living	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
class,	1
we	1
may	1
credit	1
amphibians	1
with	1
such	1
important	1
acquisitions	1
as	1
fingers	1
and	1
toes,	1
a	1
three-chambered	1
heart,	1
true	1
ventral	1
lungs,	1
a	1
drum	1
to	1
the	1
ear,	1
a	1
mobile	1
tongue,	1
and	1
vocal	1
cords.	1
When	1
animals	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
grasp	1
an	1
object	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
utter	1
sufficient	1
sounds,	1
two	1
new	1
doors	1
were	1
opened.	1
Apart	1
from	1
insects,	1
whose	1
instrumental	1
music	1
had	1
probably	1
begun	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Devonian	1
age,	1
amphibians	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
animals	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
voice.	1
The	1
primary	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
voice	1
was	1
doubtless,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to-day	1
in	1
our	1
frogs,	1
a	1
sex-call;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
destined	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
the	1
mind.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
ages	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
broadened	1
out;	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
parental	1
call;	1
it	1
became	1
an	1
infant's	1
cry.	1
Broadening	1
still,	1
it	1
became	1
a	1
very	1
useful	1
means	1
of	1
recognition	1
among	1
kindred,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
intricacies	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
Ages	1
passed,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
rose	1
on	1
another	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
evolutionary	1
spiral	1
to	1
be	1
expressive	1
of	1
particular	1
emotions	1
beyond	1
the	1
immediate	1
circle	1
of	1
sex--emotions	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
of	1
fear,	1
of	1
jealousy	1
and	1
of	1
contentment.	1
Finally,	1
we	1
judge,	1
the	1
animal--perhaps	1
the	1
bird	1
was	1
first--began	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
particular	1
"words,"	1
indicative	1
not	1
merely	1
of	1
emotions,	1
but	1
of	1
particular	1
things	1
with	1
an	1
emotional	1
halo,	1
such	1
as	1
"food,"	1
"enemy,"	1
"home."	1
Long	1
afterwards,	1
words	1
became	1
_in	1
man_	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
reasoned	1
discourse.	1
Sentences	1
were	1
made	1
and	1
judgments	1
expressed.	1
But	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
beginning	1
in	1
the	1
croaking	1
of	1
Amphibia?	1
Senses	1
of	1
Amphibians	1
Frogs	1
have	1
good	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
toad's	1
eyes	1
are	1
"jewels."	1
There	1
is	1
evidence	1
of	1
precise	1
vision	1
in	1
the	1
neat	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
frog	1
catches	1
a	1
fly,	1
flicking	1
out	1
its	1
tongue,	1
which	1
is	1
fixed	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
loose	1
behind.	1
There	1
is	1
also	1
experimental	1
proof	1
that	1
a	1
frog	1
discriminates	1
between	1
red	1
and	1
blue,	1
or	1
between	1
red	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
an	1
interesting	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
while	1
our	1
skin	1
is	1
sensitive	1
to	1
heat	1
rays	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
light,	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
the	1
frog	1
answers	1
back	1
to	1
light	1
rays	1
as	1
well.	1
Professor	1
Yerkes	1
experimented	1
with	1
a	1
frog	1
which	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
a	1
simple	1
labyrinth	1
if	1
it	1
wished	1
to	1
reach	1
a	1
tank	1
of	1
water.	1
At	1
the	1
first	1
alternative	1
between	1
two	1
paths,	1
a	1
red	1
card	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
When	1
the	1
frog	1
had	1
learned	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
correct	1
path,	1
marked	1
by	1
the	1
white	1
card,	1
Prof.	1
Yerkes	1
changed	1
the	1
cards.	1
The	1
confusion	1
of	1
the	1
frog	1
showed	1
how	1
thoroughly	1
it	1
had	1
learned	1
its	1
lesson.	1
We	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
or	1
taste	1
in	1
amphibians;	1
but	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hearing	1
is	1
well	1
developed,	1
more	1
developed	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
the	1
indifference	1
that	1
frogs	1
show	1
to	1
almost	1
all	1
sounds	1
except	1
the	1
croaking	1
of	1
their	1
kindred	1
and	1
splashes	1
in	1
the	1
water.	1
The	1
toad	1
looks	1
almost	1
sagacious	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
climbing	1
up	1
a	1
bank,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
tree-frogs	1
are	1
very	1
alert;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
that	1
we	1
dare	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
amphibian	1
mind.	1
We	1
have	1
mentioned	1
that	1
frogs	1
may	1
learn	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
maze,	1
and	1
toads	1
sometimes	1
make	1
for	1
a	1
particular	1
spawning-pond	1
from	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance.	1
But	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
their	1
brains,	1
occupying	1
a	1
relatively	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
broad,	1
flat	1
skull,	1
warns	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
expect	1
much	1
intelligence.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
when	1
we	1
take	1
frogs	1
along	1
a	1
line	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
vital	1
to	1
them,	1
namely,	1
the	1
discrimination	1
of	1
palatable	1
and	1
unpalatable	1
insects,	1
we	1
find,	1
by	1
experiment,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
quick	1
to	1
learn	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
remember	1
their	1
lessons	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
Frogs	1
sometimes	1
deposit	1
their	1
eggs	1
in	1
very	1
unsuitable	1
pools	1
of	1
water;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
it	1
looks.	1
The	1
egg-laying	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
that	1
has	1
been,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
instinctive	1
registration.	1

must	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
amphibians	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
made	1
many	1
experiments	1

solution	1
of	1
the	1
problem	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
race.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
solution,	1
that	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
associated	1
with	1
an	1
economical	1
reduction	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
eggs.	1
Thus	1
the	1
male	1
of	1
the	1
Nurse-Frog	1
(Alytes),	1
not	1
uncommon	1
on	1
the	1
Continent,	1
fixes	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
twenty	1
to	1
fifty	1
eggs	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
hind-legs,	1
and	1
retires	1
to	1
his	1
hole,	1
only	1
coming	1
out	1
at	1
night	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
food	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
moisture	1
about	1
the	1
eggs.	1
In	1
three	1
weeks,	1
when	1
the	1
tadpoles	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
come	1
out,	1
he	1
plunges	1
into	1
the	1
pond	1
and	1
is	1
freed	1
from	1
his	1
living	1
burden	1
and	1
his	1
family	1
cares.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
thoroughly	1
aquatic	1
Surinam	1
Toad	1
(Pipa),	1
the	1
male	1
helps	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
eggs,	1
perhaps	1
a	1
hundred	1
in	1
number,	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
female,	1
where	1
each	1
sinks	1
into	1
a	1
pocket	1
of	1
skin	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
lid.	1
By	1
and	1
by	1
fully	1
formed	1
young	1
toads	1
jump	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
pockets.	1
In	1
the	1
South	1
American	1
tree-frogs	1
called	1
Nototrema	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
pouch	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
eggs	1
develop,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
interesting	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
species	1
what	1
come	1
out	1
are	1
ordinary	1
tadpoles,	1
while	1
in	1
other	1
species	1
the	1
young	1
emerge	1
as	1
miniatures	1
of	1
their	1
parents.	1
Strangest	1
of	1
all,	1
perhaps,	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Darwin's	1
Frog	1
(Rhinoderma	1
of	1
Chili),	1
where	1
the	1
young,	1
about	1
ten	1
to	1
fifteen	1
in	1
number,	1
develop	1
in	1
the	1
male's	1
croaking-sacs,	1
which	1
become	1
in	1
consequence	1
enormously	1
distended.	1
Eventually	1
the	1
strange	1
spectacle	1
is	1
seen	1
of	1
miniature	1
frogs	1
jumping	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
father's	1
mouth.	1
Needless	1
to	1
say	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
citing	1
these	1
methods	1
of	1
parental	1
care	1
as	1
examples	1
of	1
intelligence;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
they	1
correct	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
amphibians	1
as	1
a	1
rather	1
humdrum	1
race.	1
Whatever	1
be	1
the	1
mental	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
facts,	1
there	1
has	1
certainly	1
been	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
experimenting,	1
and	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
parental	1
care,	1
so	1
marked	1
in	1
many	1
amphibians,	1
with	1
associated	1
reduction	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
offspring	1
is	1
a	1
finger-post	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
progress.	1
§	1

The	1
Reptilian	1
Mind	1
We	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
serpent;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
easy	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
phrase.	1
Among	1
all	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
reptiles--snakes,	1
lizards,	1
turtles,	1
and	1
crocodiles,	1
a	1
motley	1
crowd--we	1
cannot	1
see	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
occasional	1
traces	1
of	1
intelligence.	1
The	1
inner	1
life	1
remains	1
a	1
tiny	1
rill.	1
No	1
doubt	1
many	1
reptiles	1
are	1
very	1
effective;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
instinctive	1
rather	1
than	1
an	1
intelligent	1
efficiency.	1
The	1
well-known	1
"soft-shell"	1
tortoise	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
swims	1
with	1
powerful	1
strokes	1
and	1
runs	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
overtaken.	1
It	1
hunts	1
vigorously	1
for	1
crayfish	1
and	1
insect	1
larvæn	1
the	1
rivers.	1
It	1
buries	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
when	1
cold	1
weather	1
comes.	1
It	1
may	1
lie	1
on	1
a	1
floating	1
log	1
ready	1
to	1
slip	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
at	1
a	1
moment's	1
notice;	1
it	1
may	1
bask	1
on	1
a	1
sunny	1
bank	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
warm	1
shallows.	1
Great	1
wariness	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
choosing	1
times	1
and	1
places	1
for	1
egg-laying.	1
The	1
mother	1
tramps	1
the	1
earth	1
down	1
upon	1
the	1
buried	1
eggs.	1
All	1
is	1
effective.	1
Similar	1
statements	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
scores	1
of	1
other	1
reptiles;	1
but	1
what	1
we	1
see	1
is	1
almost	1
wholly	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
instinctive	1
routine,	1
and	1
we	1
get	1
little	1
glimpse	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
efficiency	1
and	1
endeavour.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
cases	1
there	1
is	1
proof	1
of	1
reptiles	1
finding	1
their	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
their	1
homes	1
from	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance,	1
and	1
recognition	1
of	1
persons	1
is	1
indubitable.	1
Gilbert	1
White	1
remarks	1
of	1
his	1
tortoise:	1
"Whenever	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
lady	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
who	1
had	1
waited	1
on	1
it	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
years,	1
it	1
always	1
hobbled	1
with	1
awkward	1
alacrity	1
towards	1
its	1
benefactress,	1
while	1
to	1
strangers	1
it	1
was	1
altogether	1
inattentive."	1
Of	1
definite	1
learning	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
records.	1
Thus	1
Professor	1
Yerkes	1
studied	1
a	1
sluggish	1
turtle	1
of	1
retiring	1
disposition,	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
its	1
strong	1
desire	1
to	1
efface	1
itself.	1
On	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
darkened	1
nest	1
of	1
damp	1
grass	1
he	1
interposed	1
a	1
simple	1
maze	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
partitioned	1
box.	1
After	1
wandering	1
about	1
constantly	1
for	1
thirty-five	1
minutes	1
the	1
turtle	1
found	1
its	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
maze	1
by	1
chance.	1
Two	1
hours	1
afterwards	1
it	1
reached	1
the	1
nest	1
in	1
fifteen	1
minutes;	1
and	1
after	1
another	1
interval	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
it	1
only	1
required	1
five	1
minutes.	1
After	1
the	1
third	1
trial,	1
the	1
routes	1
became	1
more	1
direct,	1
there	1
was	1
less	1
aimless	1
wandering.	1
The	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
twentieth	1
trial	1
was	1
forty-five	1
seconds;	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
thirtieth,	1
forty	1
seconds.	1
In	1
the	1
thirtieth	1
case,	1
the	1
path	1
followed	1
was	1
quite	1
direct,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
fiftieth	1
trip,	1
which	1
only	1
required	1
thirty-five	1
seconds.	1
Of	1
course,	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
did	1
not	1
amount	1
to	1
very	1
much;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
definite	1
learning,	1
_a	1
learning	1
from	1
experience_,	1
which	1
has	1
played	1
an	1
important	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
animal	1
behaviour.	1
Comparing	1
reptiles	1
with	1
amphibians,	1
we	1
may	1
recognise	1
an	1
increased	1
masterliness	1
of	1
behaviour	1
and	1
a	1
hint	1
of	1
greater	1
plasticity.	1
The	1
records	1
of	1
observers	1
who	1
have	1
made	1
pets	1
of	1
reptiles	1
suggest	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
feeling	1
or	1
emotion	1
is	1
growing	1
stronger,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
stories,	1
if	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
accepted,	1
which	1
suggest	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
conjugal	1
affection.	1
The	1
error	1
must	1
be	1
guarded	1
against	1
of	1
interpreting	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
intelligence	1
what	1
is	1
merely	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
long-continued	1
structure	1
adaptation.	1
When	1
the	1
limbless	1
lizard	1
called	1
the	1
Slow-worm	1
is	1
suddenly	1
seized	1
by	1
the	1
tail,	1
it	1
escapes	1
by	1
surrendering	1
the	1
appendage,	1
which	1
breaks	1
across	1
a	1
preformed	1
weak	1
plane.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
reflex	1
action,	1
not	1
a	1
reflective	1
one.	1
It	1
is	1
comparable	1
to	1
our	1
sudden	1
withdrawal	1
of	1
our	1
finger	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
hot	1
cinder.	1
The	1
Egg-eating	1
African	1
snake	1
Dasypeltis	1
gets	1
the	1
egg	1
of	1
a	1
bird	1
into	1
its	1
gullet	1
unbroken,	1
and	1
cuts	1
the	1
shell	1
against	1
downward-projecting	1
sharp	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
vertebræNone	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
contents	1
is	1
lost	1
and	1
the	1
broken	1
"empties"	1
are	1
returned.	1
It	1
is	1
admirable,	1
indeed	1
unsurpassable;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
intelligent.	1
§	1

Mind	1
in	1
Birds	1
Sight	1
and	1
hearing	1
are	1
highly	1
developed	1
in	1
birds,	1
and	1
the	1
senses,	1
besides	1
pulling	1
the	1
triggers	1
of	1
inborn	1
efficiencies,	1
supply	1
the	1
raw	1
materials	1
for	1
intelligence.	1
There	1
is	1
some	1
truth,	1
though	1
not	1
the	1
whole	1
truth,	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
philosophical	1
dictum,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
intellect	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
previously	1
in	1
the	1
senses.	1
Many	1
people	1
have	1
admired	1
the	1
certainty	1
and	1
alacrity	1
with	1
which	1
gulls	1
pick	1
up	1
a	1
fragment	1
of	1
biscuit	1
from	1
the	1
white	1
wake	1
of	1
a	1
steamer,	1
and	1
the	1
incident	1
is	1
characteristic.	1
In	1
their	1
power	1
of	1
rapidly	1
altering	1
the	1
focus	1
of	1
the	1
eye,	1
birds	1
are	1
unsurpassed.	1
To	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
sight	1
in	1
birds,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hearing	1
comes	1
a	1
good	1
second.	1
A	1
twig	1
breaks	1
under	1
our	1
feet,	1
and	1
out	1
sounds	1
the	1
danger-call	1
of	1
the	1
bird	1
we	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
watch.	1
Many	1
young	1
birds,	1
like	1
partridges,	1
respond	1
when	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
hours	1
old	1
to	1
the	1
anxious	1
warning	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
parents,	1
and	1
squat	1
motionless	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
though	1
other	1
sounds,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
excited	1
clucking	1
of	1
a	1
foster-mother	1
hen,	1
leave	1
them	1
indifferent.	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
doing	1
when	1
they	1
squat;	1
they	1
are	1
obeying	1
the	1
living	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
them.	1
Their	1
behaviour	1
is	1
instinctive.	1
But	1
the	1
present	1
point	1
is	1
the	1
discriminating	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hearing;	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
corroborated	1
by	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
birds.	1
It	1
is	1
emotional	1
art,	1
expressing	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
sound.	1
On	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
females,	1
who	1
are	1
supposed	1
to	1
listen,	1
it	1
betokens	1
a	1
cultivated	1
ear.	1

broken	1

found	1
around	1

As	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
senses,	1
touch	1
is	1
not	1
highly	1
developed	1
except	1
about	1
the	1
bill,	1
where	1
it	1
reaches	1
a	1
climax	1
in	1
birds	1
like	1
the	1
wood-cock,	1
which	1
probe	1
for	1
unseen	1
earthworms	1
in	1
the	1
soft	1
soil.	1
Taste	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
poorly	1
developed,	1
for	1
most	1
birds	1
bolt	1
their	1
food,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
sometimes	1
an	1
emphatic	1
rejection	1
of	1
unpalatable	1
things,	1
like	1
toads	1
and	1
caterpillars.	1
Of	1
smell	1
in	1
birds	1
little	1
is	1
known,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
in	1
certain	1
cases,	1
e.g.	1
in	1
some	1
nocturnal	1
birds	1
of	1
prey.	1
It	1
seems	1
certain	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
sight,	1
not	1
by	1
smell,	1
that	1
the	1
eagles	1
gather	1
to	1
the	1
carcass;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
smell	1
in	1
birds	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
usually	1
credited	1
with.	1
One	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
experiment	1
with	1
the	1
oil	1
from	1
the	1
preen	1
gland	1
of	1
birds	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
help	1
in	1
the	1
recognition	1
of	1
kin	1
by	1
kin	1
at	1
night	1
or	1
amid	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
There	1
may	1
be	1
other	1
senses	1
in	1
birds,	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
temperature	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
balance;	1
but	1
no	1
success	1
has	1
attended	1
the	1
attempts	1
made	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
a	1
magnetic	1
sense,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
impatiently	1
postulated	1
by	1
students	1
of	1
bird	1
migration	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
"explain"	1
how	1
the	1
birds	1
find	1
their	1
way.	1
The	1
big	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
birds	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
widely	1
open	1
gateways	1
of	1
knowledge,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
sight	1
and	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
hearing.	1
Instinctive	1
Aptitudes	1
Many	1
a	1
young	1
water-bird,	1
such	1
as	1
a	1
coot,	1
swims	1
right	1
away	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
tumbled	1
into	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
So	1
chicks	1
peck	1
without	1
any	1
learning	1
or	1
teaching,	1
very	1
young	1
ducklings	1
catch	1
small	1
moths	1
that	1
flit	1
by,	1
and	1
young	1
plovers	1
lie	1
low	1
when	1
the	1
danger-signal	1
sounds.	1
But	1
birds	1
seem	1
strangely	1
limited	1
as	1
regards	1
many	1
of	1
these	1
instinctive	1
capacities--limited	1
when	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
"little-brained"	1
ants	1
and	1
bees,	1
which	1
have	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
such	1
a	1
rich	1
repertory	1
of	1
ready-made	1
cleverness.	1
The	1
limitation	1
in	1
birds	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
interest,	1
for	1
it	1
means	1
that	1
intelligence	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
and	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
reins	1
at	1
many	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
daily	1
round.	1
Professor	1
Lloyd	1
Morgan	1
observed	1
that	1
his	1
chickens	1
incubated	1
in	1
the	1
laboratory	1
had	1
no	1
instinctive	1
awareness	1
of	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
their	1
mother's	1
cluck	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
brought	1
outside	1
the	1
door.	1
Although	1
thirsty	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
drink	1
from	1
a	1
moistened	1
finger-tip,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
instinctively	1
recognize	1
water,	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
walked	1
through	1
a	1
saucerful.	1
Only	1
when	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
peck	1
their	1
toes	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
did	1
they	1
appreciate	1
water	1
as	1
the	1
stuff	1
they	1
wanted,	1
and	1
raise	1
their	1
bills	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
they	1
actually	1
stuffed	1
their	1
crops	1
with	1
"worms"	1
of	1
red	1
worsted!	1
Instinctive	1
aptitudes,	1
then,	1
the	1
young	1
birds	1
have,	1
but	1
these	1
are	1
more	1
limited	1
than	1
in	1
ants,	1
bees,	1
and	1
wasps;	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
brain	1
is	1
now	1
evolving	1
on	1
the	1
tack	1
of	1
what	1
Sir	1
Ray	1
Lankester	1
has	1
called	1
"educability."	1
Young	1
birds	1
_learn_	1
with	1
prodigious	1
rapidity;	1
the	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
from	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
hereditary	1
obligations	1
has	1
begun.	1
Young	1
birds	1
make	1
mistakes,	1
like	1
the	1
red	1
worsted	1
mistake,	1
but	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
mistakes	1
often.	1
They	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
experience	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
rapid	1
way.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
creatures	1
of	1
the	1
little-brain	1
type,	1
like	1
ants,	1
bees,	1
and	1
wasps,	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
experience	1
or	1
are	1
without	1
intelligence.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
such	1
hard-and-fast	1
lines.	1
We	1
mean	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
life	1
of	1
insects	1
the	1
enregistered	1
instinctive	1
capacities	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
occasion,	1
and	1
that	1
intelligent	1
educability	1
is	1
very	1
slightly	1
developed.	1
Nor	1
do	1
we	1
mean	1
that	1
birds	1
are	1
quite	1
emancipated	1
from	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
engrained	1
instinctive	1
obligations,	1
and	1
can	1
always	1
"ring	1
up"	1
intelligence	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
stereotyped	1
bee.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
pigeon	1
brooding	1
on	1
an	1
empty	1
nest,	1
while	1
her	1
two	1
eggs	1
lie	1
disregarded	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
inches	1
away,	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
along	1
certain	1
lines	1
birds	1
may	1
find	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
trammels	1
of	1
instinct.	1
The	1
peculiar	1
interest	1
of	1
birds	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
many	1
instincts	1
and	1
yet	1
a	1
notable	1
power	1
of	1
learning	1
intelligently.	1
Intelligence	1
co-operating	1
with	1
Instinct	1
Professor	1
Lloyd	1
Morgan	1
was	1
foster-parent	1
to	1
two	1
moorhens	1
which	1
grew	1
up	1
in	1
isolation	1
from	1
their	1
kindred.	1
They	1
swam	1
instinctively,	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
dive,	1
neither	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
bath	1
nor	1
in	1
a	1
current.	1
But	1
it	1
happened	1
one	1
day	1
when	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
moorhens	1
was	1
swimming	1
in	1
a	1
pool	1
on	1
a	1
Yorkshire	1
stream,	1
that	1
a	1
puppy	1
came	1
barking	1
down	1
the	1
bank	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
awkward	1
feint	1
towards	1
the	1
young	1
bird.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
moorhen	1
dived,	1
disappeared	1
from	1
view,	1
and	1
soon	1
partially	1
reappeared,	1
his	1
head	1
just	1
peeping	1
above	1
the	1
water	1
beneath	1
the	1
overhanging	1
bank.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
the	1
bird	1
had	1
dived,	1
and	1
the	1
performance	1
was	1
absolutely	1
true	1
to	1
type.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
observation.	1
The	1
moorhen	1
has	1
an	1
hereditary	1
or	1
instinctive	1
capacity	1
for	1
swimming	1
and	1
diving,	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
easily	1
called	1
into	1
activity	1
as	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
particular	1
moorhen	1
in	1
question	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
about	1
two	1
months	1
of	1
swimming	1
experience,	1
which	1
probably	1
counted	1
for	1
something,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
experience	1
nothing	1
had	1
pulled	1
the	1
trigger	1
of	1
the	1
diving	1
capacity.	1
On	1
an	1
eventful	1
day	1
the	1
young	1
moorhen	1
saw	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
dog;	1
it	1
was	1
emotionally	1
excited;	1
it	1
probably	1
did	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
intelligently	1
appreciate	1
a	1
novel	1
and	1
meaningful	1
situation.	1
Intelligence	1
cooperated	1
with	1
instinct,	1
and	1
the	1
bird	1
dived	1
appropriately.	1
Birds	1
have	1
inborn	1
predispositions	1
to	1
certain	1
effective	1
ways	1
of	1
pecking,	1
scratching,	1
swimming,	1
diving,	1
flying,	1
crouching,	1
lying	1
low,	1
nest-building,	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
marked	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
much	1
more	1
purely	1
instinctive	1
ants	1
and	1
bees	1
by	1
the	1
extent	1
to	1
which	1
individual	1
"nurture"	1
seems	1
to	1
mingle	1
with	1
the	1
inherited	1
"nature."	1
The	1
two	1
together	1
result	1
in	1
the	1
fine	1
product	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
the	1
bird's	1
behaviour.	1
After	1
Lloyd	1
Morgan's	1
chicks	1
had	1
tried	1
a	1
few	1
conspicuous	1
and	1
unpalatable	1
caterpillars,	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
any	1
more.	1
They	1
learned	1
in	1
their	1
early	1
days	1
with	1
prodigious	1
rapidity,	1
illustrating	1
the	1
deep	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
"big-brain"	1
type,	1
relatively	1
poor	1
in	1
its	1
endowment	1
of	1
instinctive	1
capacities,	1
but	1
eminently	1
"educable,"	1
and	1
the	1
"little-brain"	1
type,	1
say,	1
of	1
ants	1
and	1
bees,	1
richly	1
endowed	1
with	1
instinctive	1
capacities,	1
but	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
quick	1
or	1
glad	1
to	1
learn.	1
We	1
owe	1
it	1
to	1
Sir	1
Ray	1
Lankester	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
that	1
these	1
two	1
types	1
of	1
brain	1
are,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
on	1
different	1
tacks	1
of	1
evolution,	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
directly	1
pitted	1
against	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
"little-brain"	1
type	1
makes	1
for	1
a	1
climax	1
in	1
the	1
ant,	1
where	1
instinctive	1
behaviour	1
reaches	1
a	1
high	1
degree	1
of	1
perfection;	1
the	1
"big-brain"	1
type	1
reaches	1
its	1
climax	1
in	1
horse	1
and	1
dog,	1
in	1
elephant	1
and	1
monkey.	1
The	1
particular	1
interest	1
that	1
attaches	1
to	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
birds	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
instinct	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
intelligent	1
learning.	1
This	1
is	1
well	1
illustrated	1
when	1
birds	1
make	1
a	1
nest	1
out	1
of	1
new	1
materials	1
or	1
in	1
some	1
quite	1
novel	1
situation.	1
It	1
is	1
clearly	1
seen	1
when	1
birds	1
turn	1
to	1
some	1
new	1
kind	1
of	1
food,	1
like	1
the	1
Kea	1
parrot,	1
which	1
attacks	1
the	1
sheep	1
in	1
New	1
Zealand.	1
Some	1
young	1
woodpeckers	1
are	1
quite	1
clever	1
in	1
opening	1
fir	1
cones	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
seeds,	1
and	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
hastily	1
referred	1
to	1
a	1
well-defined	1
hereditary	1
capacity.	1
But	1
the	1
facts	1
are	1
that	1
the	1
parents	1
bring	1
their	1
young	1
ones	1
first	1
the	1
seeds	1
themselves,	1
then	1
partly	1
opened	1
cones,	1
and	1
then	1
intact	1
ones.	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
educative	1
process,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
scores	1
of	1
cases.	1
Using	1
their	1
Wits	1
When	1
the	1
Greek	1
eagle	1
lifts	1
the	1
Greek	1
tortoise	1
in	1
its	1
talons,	1
and	1
lets	1
it	1
fall	1
from	1
a	1
height	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
strong	1
carapace	1
is	1
broken	1
and	1
the	1
flesh	1
exposed,	1
it	1
is	1
making	1
intelligent	1
use	1
of	1
an	1
expedient.	1
Whether	1
it	1
discovered	1
the	1
expedient	1
by	1
experimenting,	1
as	1
is	1
possible,	1
or	1
by	1
chance,	1
as	1
is	1
more	1
likely,	1
it	1
uses	1
it	1
intelligently.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
herring-gulls	1
lift	1
sea-urchins	1
and	1
clams	1
in	1
their	1
bills,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
rocks	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
shells	1
are	1
broken.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
rooks	1
deal	1
with	1
freshwater	1
mussels.	1
The	1
Thrush's	1
Anvil	1
A	1
very	1
instructive	1
case	1
is	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
song-thrush	1
when	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
wood-snail	1
in	1
its	1
beak	1
and	1
hammers	1
it	1
against	1
a	1
stone,	1
its	1
so-called	1
anvil.	1
To	1
a	1
young	1
thrush,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
hand,	1
Miss	1
Frances	1
Pitt	1
offered	1
some	1
wood-snails,	1
but	1
it	1
took	1
no	1
interest	1
in	1
them	1
until	1
one	1
put	1
out	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
about.	1
The	1
bird	1
then	1
pecked	1
at	1
the	1
snail's	1
horns,	1
but	1
was	1
evidently	1
puzzled	1
when	1
the	1
creature	1
retreated	1
within	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
shell.	1
This	1
happened	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again,	1
the	1
thrush's	1
inquisitive	1
interest	1
increasing	1
day	1
by	1
day.	1
It	1
pecked	1
at	1
the	1
shell	1
and	1
even	1
picked	1
it	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
lip,	1
but	1
no	1
real	1
progress	1
was	1
made	1
till	1
the	1
sixth	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
thrush	1
seized	1
the	1
snail	1
and	1
beat	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
a	1
big	1
worm.	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
it	1
picked	1
up	1
a	1
shell	1
and	1
knocked	1
it	1
repeatedly	1
against	1
a	1
stone,	1
trying	1
first	1
one	1
snail	1
and	1
then	1
another.	1
After	1
fifteen	1
minutes'	1
hard	1
work,	1
the	1
thrush	1
managed	1
to	1
break	1
one,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
easy.	1
A	1
certain	1
predisposition	1
to	1
beat	1
things	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
doubtless	1
present,	1
but	1
the	1
experiment	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
an	1
anvil	1
could	1
be	1
arrived	1
at	1
by	1
an	1
untutored	1
bird.	1
After	1
prolonged	1
trying	1
it	1
found	1
out	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
a	1
difficult	1
situation.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
more	1
natural	1
conditions	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
picked	1
up	1
by	1
imitation,	1
but	1
while	1
this	1
is	1
quite	1
possible,	1
it	1
is	1
useful	1
to	1
notice	1
that	1
experiments	1
with	1
animals	1
lead	1
us	1
to	1
doubt	1
whether	1
imitation	1
counts	1
for	1
nearly	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
believed.	1
§	1
6	1
The	1
Mind	1
of	1
the	1
Mammal	1
When	1
we	1
watch	1
a	1
collie	1
at	1
a	1
sheep-driving	1
competition,	1
or	1
an	1
elephant	1
helping	1
the	1
forester,	1
or	1
a	1
horse	1
shunting	1
waggons	1
at	1
a	1
railway	1
siding,	1
we	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
generous	1
to	1
the	1
mammal	1
mind.	1
For	1
in	1
the	1
cases	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
mentioned,	1
part	1
of	1
man's	1
mind	1
has,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
animal's.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
when	1
we	1
study	1
rabbits	1
and	1
guinea-pigs,	1
we	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
stingy,	1
for	1
these	1
rodents	1
are	1
under	1
the	1
average	1
of	1
mammals,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
live	1
in	1
domestication	1
illustrate	1
the	1
stupefying	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
too	1
sheltered	1
life.	1
The	1
same	1
applies	1
to	1
domesticated	1
sheep	1
contrasted	1
with	1
wild	1
sheep,	1
or	1
even	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
lambs.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
sound	1
judgment	1
on	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
mammals	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
attend	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
profited	1
by	1
man's	1
training,	1
nor	1
to	1
those	1
whose	1
mental	1
life	1
has	1
been	1
dulled	1
by	1
domestication.	1
Instinctive	1
Aptitudes	1
What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
beavers	1
who	1
gnaw	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
with	1
their	1
chisel-edged	1
teeth	1
till	1
only	1
a	1
narrow	1
core	1
is	1
left--to	1
snap	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
gale,	1
bringing	1
the	1
useful	1
branches	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
ground?	1
What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
harvest-mouse	1
constructing	1
its	1
nest,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
squirrel	1
making	1
cache	1
after	1
cache	1
of	1
nuts?	1
These	1
and	1
many	1
similar	1
pieces	1
of	1
behaviour	1
are	1
fundamentally	1
instinctive,	1
due	1
to	1
inborn	1
predispositions	1
of	1
nerve-cells	1
and	1
muscle-cells.	1
But	1
in	1
mammals	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
often	1
attended	1
by	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
intelligent	1
attention,	1
saving	1
the	1
creature	1
from	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
routine	1
so	1
marked	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1

and	1
bees.	1
Sheer	1
Dexterity	1
Besides	1
instinctive	1
aptitudes,	1
which	1
are	1
exhibited	1
in	1
almost	1
equal	1
perfection	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
species,	1
there	1
are	1
acquired	1
dexterities	1
which	1
depend	1
on	1
individual	1
opportunities.	1
They	1
are	1
also	1
marked	1
by	1
being	1
outside	1
and	1
beyond	1
ordinary	1
routine--not	1
that	1
any	1
rigorous	1
boundary	1
line	1
can	1
be	1
drawn.	1
We	1
read	1
that	1
at	1

by	1
the	1
piety	1

sacred	1
river-tortoises,	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
crowded	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
food	1
going	1

their	1
smooth	1
carapaces	1

a	1

a	1

of	1
the	1
booty.	1

is	1
almost	1
a	1
diagram	1
of	1
sheer	1
dexterity.	1
It	1
illustrates	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
adventure,	1
the	1
will	1
to	1
experiment,	1
which	1
is,	1
we	1
believe,	1
the	1
main	1
motive-force	1
in	1
new	1
departures	1
in	1
behaviour.	1

Power	1
of	1
Association	1
A	1
bull-terrier	1
called	1
Jasper,	1
studied	1
by	1
Prof.	1
J.	1
B.	1
Watson,	1
showed	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
associating	1
certain	1
words	1
with	1
certain	1
actions.	1
From	1
a	1
position	1
invisible	1
to	1
the	1
dog	1
the	1
owner	1
would	1
give	1
certain	1
commands,	1
such	1
as	1
"Go	1
into	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
paper	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
floor."	1
Jasper	1
did	1
this	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
a	1
score	1
of	1
similar	1
things.	1
Lord	1
Avebury's	1
dog	1
Van	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
box	1
containing	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
printed	1
cards	1
and	1
select	1
the	1
card	1
TEA	1
or	1
OUT,	1
as	1
the	1
occasion	1
suggested.	1
It	1
had	1
established	1
an	1
association	1
between	1
certain	1
black	1
marks	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
background	1
and	1
the	1
gratification	1
of	1
certain	1
desires.	1
It	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
things	1
horses	1
and	1
dogs	1
have	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
stamping	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
times	1
in	1
supposed	1
indication	1
of	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
an	1
arithmetical	1
question	1
(in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
horses),	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
an	1
object	1
drawn	1
(in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
dogs),	1
are	1
dependent	1
on	1
clever	1
associations	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
teacher	1
between	1
minute	1
signs	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
stampings.	1
What	1
is	1
certain	1
is	1
that	1
mammals	1
have	1
in	1
varying	1
degrees	1
a	1
strong	1
power	1
of	1
establishing	1
associations.	1
There	1
is	1
often	1
some	1
delicacy	1
in	1
the	1
association	1
established.	1
Everyone	1
knows	1
of	1
cases	1
where	1
a	1
dog,	1
a	1
cat,	1
or	1
a	1
horse	1
will	1
remain	1
quite	1
uninterested,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
in	1
its	1
owner's	1
movements	1
until	1
some	1
little	1
detail,	1
such	1
as	1
taking	1
a	1
key	1
from	1
its	1
peg,	1
pulls	1
the	1
trigger.	1
Now	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
fox	1
or	1
the	1
hare,	1
the	1
otter	1
or	1
the	1
squirrel,	1
is	1
obviously	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
animals	1
learn	1
to	1
associate	1
certain	1
sounds	1
in	1
their	1
environment	1
with	1
definite	1
possibilities.	1
They	1
have	1
to	1
learn	1
an	1
alphabet	1
of	1
woodcraft,	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
chiefly	1
sounds	1
and	1
scents.	1
The	1
Dancing	1
Mouse	1
as	1
a	1
Pupil	1
The	1
dancing	1
or	1
waltzing	1
mouse	1
is	1
a	1
Japanese	1
variety	1
with	1
many	1
peculiarities,	1
such	1
as	1
having	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
semicircular	1
canals	1
of	1
the	1
ear	1
well	1
developed.	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
strong	1
tendency	1
to	1
waltz	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
in	1
circles	1
without	1
sufficient	1
cause	1
and	1
to	1
trip	1
sideways	1
towards	1
its	1
dormitory	1
instead	1
of	1
proceeding	1
in	1
the	1
orthodox	1
head-on	1
fashion.	1
But	1
this	1
freak	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
educable	1
creature,	1
as	1
Professor	1
Yerkes	1
has	1
shown.	1
In	1
a	1
careful	1
way	1
he	1
confronted	1
his	1
mouse-pupil	1
with	1
alternative	1
pathways	1
marked	1
by	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
illumination,	1
or	1
by	1
different	1
colours.	1
If	1
the	1
mouse	1
chose	1
compartment	1
A,	1
it	1
found	1
a	1
clear	1
passage	1
direct	1
to	1
its	1
nest;	1
if	1
it	1
chose	1
compartment	1
B,	1
it	1
was	1
punished	1
by	1
a	1
mild	1
electric	1
shock	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
roundabout	1
road	1
home.	1
Needless	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
A	1
compartment	1
was	1
sometimes	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
hand,	1
sometimes	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
else	1
mere	1
position	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
guide.	1
The	1
experiments	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
dancing	1
mice	1
learn	1
to	1
discriminate	1
the	1
right	1
path	1
from	1
the	1
wrong,	1
and	1
similar	1
results	1
have	1
been	1
got	1
from	1
other	1
mammals,	1
such	1
as	1
rats	1
and	1
squirrels.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
proof	1
of	1
learning	1
by	1
ideas,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
proof	1
of	1
learning	1
by	1
experience.	1
And	1
the	1
same	1
must	1
be	1
true	1
in	1
wild	1
life.	1
Many	1
mammals,	1
such	1
as	1
cats	1
and	1
rats,	1
learn	1
how	1
to	1
manipulate	1
puzzle-boxes	1
and	1
how	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
the	1
treasure	1
at	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
Hampton	1
Court	1
maze.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
puzzle-boxes,	1
with	1
a	1
reward	1
of	1
food	1
inside,	1
are	1
quite	1
difficult,	1
for	1
the	1
various	1
bolts	1
and	1
bars	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
order,	1
and	1
yet	1
many	1
mammals	1
master	1
the	1
problem.	1
What	1
is	1
plain	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
gradually	1
eliminate	1
useless	1
movements,	1
that	1
they	1
make	1
fewer	1
and	1
fewer	1
mistakes,	1
that	1
they	1
eventually	1
succeed,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
register	1
the	1
solution	1
within	1
themselves	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
remains	1
with	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
It	1
looks	1
a	1
little	1
like	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
learns	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
skill	1
without	1
thinking.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
learning	1
by	1
experience,	1
not	1
by	1
ideas	1
or	1
reflection.	1
Thus	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
a	1
rat	1
or	1
a	1
cat	1
could	1
form	1
any	1
idea	1
or	1
even	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
Hampton	1
Court	1
maze--which	1
they	1
nevertheless	1
master.	1
Learning	1
Tricks	1
Given	1
sufficient	1
inducement	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
cleverer	1
mammals	1
will	1
learn	1
to	1
do	1
very	1
sensible	1
things,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
wise	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
understand	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
doing.	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
trained	1
animals	1
often	1
exhibit	1
pieces	1
of	1
behaviour	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
they	1
look.	1
The	1
elephant	1
at	1
the	1
Belle	1
Vue	1
Gardens	1
in	1
Manchester	1
used	1
to	1
collect	1
pennies	1
from	1
benevolent	1
visitors.	1
When	1
it	1
got	1
a	1
penny	1
in	1
its	1
trunk	1
it	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
slot	1
of	1
an	1
automatic	1
machine	1
which	1
delivered	1
up	1
a	1
biscuit.	1
When	1
a	1
visitor	1
gave	1
the	1
elephant	1
a	1
halfpenny	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
back	1
with	1
disgust.	1
At	1
first	1
sight	1
this	1
seemed	1
almost	1
wise,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
some	1
intelligent	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
situation.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
largely	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
habituation,	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
careful	1
and	1
prolonged	1
training.	1
The	1
elephant	1
was	1
laboriously	1
taught	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
penny	1
in	1
the	1
slot	1
and	1
to	1
discriminate	1
between	1
the	1
useful	1
pennies	1
and	1
the	1
useless	1
halfpennies.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
nearly	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
it	1
looked.	1
Using	1
their	1
Wits	1
In	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Zoological	1
Park	1
in	1
Edinburgh	1
the	1
Polar	1
Bear	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
sit	1
on	1
a	1
rocky	1
peninsula	1
of	1
a	1
water-filled	1
quarry.	1
The	1
visitors	1
threw	1
in	1
buns,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
floated	1
on	1
the	1
surface.	1
It	1
was	1
often	1
easy	1
for	1
the	1
Polar	1
Bear	1
to	1
collect	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
by	1
plunging	1
into	1
the	1
pool.	1
But	1
it	1
had	1
discovered	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
way.	1
At	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
peninsula	1
it	1
scooped	1
the	1
water	1
gently	1
with	1
its	1
huge	1
paw	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
current	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
buns	1
ashore.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
simple	1
piece	1
of	1
behaviour,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
smack	1
of	1
intelligence--of	1
putting	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
novel	1
way.	1
It	1
suggests	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
"perceptual	1
inference."	1
On	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
flood	1
in	1
a	1
meadow	1
it	1
was	1
observed	1
that	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
mares	1
brought	1
their	1
foals	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
knoll,	1
and	1
stood	1
round	1
about	1
them	1
protecting	1
them	1
against	1
the	1
rising	1
water.	1
A	1
dog	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
show	1
what	1
was	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
plastic	1
appreciation	1
of	1
a	1
varying	1
situation	1
in	1
swimming	1
across	1
a	1
tidal	1
river.	1
It	1
changed	1
its	1
starting-point,	1
they	1
say,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
flow	1
or	1
ebb	1
of	1
the	1
tide.	1
Arctic	1
foxes	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
wild	1
mammals	1
show	1
great	1
cleverness	1
in	1
dealing	1
with	1
traps,	1
and	1
the	1
manipulative	1
intelligence	1
of	1
elephants	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
admiration.	1
§	1

Why	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
more	1
Intelligence?	1
When	1
we	1
allow	1
for	1
dexterity	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
association,	1
when	1
we	1
recognise	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
instinctive	1
capacity	1
and	1
a	1
capacity	1
for	1
profiting	1
by	1
experience	1
in	1
an	1
intelligent	1
way,	1
we	1
must	1
admit	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
disappointment	1
when	1
we	1
take	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
mammals,	1
especially	1
of	1
those	1
with	1
very	1
fine	1
brains,	1
from	1
which	1
we	1
should	1
naturally	1
expect	1
great	1
things.	1
Why	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
more	1
frequent	1
exhibition	1
of	1
intelligence	1
in	1
the	1
stricter	1
sense?	1
The	1
answer	1
is	1
that	1
most	1
mammals	1
have	1
become	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
very	1
well	1
adapted	1
to	1
the	1
ordinary	1
conditions	1
of	1
their	1
life,	1
and	1
tend	1
to	1
leave	1
well	1
alone.	1
They	1
have	1
got	1
their	1
repertory	1
of	1
efficient	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
ordinary	1
questions	1
of	1
everyday	1
life,	1
and	1
why	1
should	1
they	1
experiment?	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
struggle	1
for	1
existence	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
established	1
is	1
efficiency	1
in	1
normal	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
therefore	1
even	1
the	1
higher	1
animals	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
cleverer	1
than	1
is	1
necessary.	1
So	1
while	1
many	1
mammals	1
are	1
extraordinarily	1
efficient,	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
dull.	1
Their	1
mental	1
equipment	1
is	1
adequate	1
for	1
the	1
everyday	1
conditions	1
of	1
their	1
life,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
sufficiently	1
generous	1
lines	1
to	1
admit	1
of,	1
let	1
us	1
say,	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
Nature	1
or	1
adventurous	1
experiment.	1
Mammals	1
always	1
tend	1
to	1
"play	1
for	1
safety."	1
We	1
hasten,	1
however,	1
to	1
insert	1
here	1
some	1
very	1
interesting	1
saving	1
clauses.	1
Experimentation	1
in	1
Play	1
A	1
glimpse	1
of	1
what	1
mammals	1
are	1
capable	1
of,	1
were	1
it	1
necessary,	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
by	1
watching	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
playful,	1
such	1
as	1
lambs	1
and	1
kids,	1
foals	1
and	1
calves,	1
young	1
foxes	1
and	1
others.	1
For	1
these	1
young	1
creatures	1
let	1
themselves	1
go	1
irresponsibly,	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
unstereotyped,	1
they	1
test	1
what	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
fellows	1
can	1
do.	1
The	1
experimental	1
character	1
of	1
much	1
of	1
animal	1
play	1
is	1
very	1
marked.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
recognised	1
by	1
biologists	1
that	1
play	1
among	1
animals	1
is	1
the	1
young	1
form	1
of	1
work,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
playing	1
period,	1
often	1
so	1
conspicuous,	1
is	1
vitally	1
important	1
as	1
an	1
apprenticeship	1
to	1
the	1
serious	1
business	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
as	1
an	1
opportunity	1
for	1
learning	1
the	1
alphabet	1
of	1
Nature.	1
But	1
the	1
playing	1
period	1
is	1
much	1
more;	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
opportunities	1
animals	1
have	1
of	1
making	1
experiments	1
without	1
too	1
serious	1
responsibilities.	1
Play	1
is	1
Nature's	1
device	1
for	1
allowing	1
elbow-room	1
for	1
new	1
departures	1
(behaviour-variations)	1
which	1
may	1
form	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
raw	1
materials	1
of	1
progress.	1
Play,	1
we	1
repeat,	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
the	1
mammal	1
mind.	1
Other	1
Glimpses	1
of	1
Intelligence	1
A	1
squirrel	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
clever	1
as	1
it	1
needs	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
no	1
more;	1
and	1
of	1
some	1
vanishing	1
mammals,	1
like	1
the	1
beaver,	1
not	1
even	1
this	1
can	1
be	1
said.	1
Humdrum	1
non-plastic	1
efficiency	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
mean	1
stagnation.	1
Now	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
young	1
mammals	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
indication	1
of	1
unexhausted	1
possibilities,	1
and	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
same	1
impression	1
when	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
three	1
other	1
facts.	1
(_a_)	1
In	1
those	1
mammals,	1
like	1
dog	1
and	1
horse,	1
which	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
active	1
cooperative	1
relations	1
with	1
man,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
mammal	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
would	1
lead	1
us	1
to	1
think.	1
When	1
man's	1
sheltering	1
is	1
too	1
complete	1
and	1
the	1
domesticated	1
creature	1
is	1
passive	1
in	1
his	1
grip,	1
the	1
intelligence	1
deteriorates.	1
(_b_)	1
When	1
we	1
study	1
mammals,	1
like	1
the	1
otter,	1
which	1
live	1
a	1
versatile	1
life	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
complex	1
and	1
difficult	1
environment,	1
we	1
get	1
an	1
inspiriting	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
wits.	1
(_c_)	1
Thirdly,	1
when	1
we	1
pass	1
to	1
monkeys,	1
where	1
the	1
fore-limb	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
free	1
hand,	1
where	1
the	1
brain	1
shows	1
a	1
relatively	1
great	1
improvement,	1
where	1
"words"	1
are	1
much	1
used,	1
we	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
emergence	1
of	1
something	1
new--a	1
restless	1
inquisitiveness,	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
world,	1
an	1
unsatisfied	1
tendency	1
to	1
experiment.	1
We	1
are	1
approaching	1
the	1
Dawn	1
of	1
Reason.	1
THE	1
MIND	1
OF	1
MONKEYS	1
§	1
8	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
gamut	1
between	1
the	1
bushy-tailed,	1
almost	1
squirrel-like	1
marmosets	1
and	1
the	1
big-brained	1
chimpanzee.	1
There	1
is	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
attainment	1
at	1
different	1
levels	1
in	1
the	1
Simian	1
tribe.	1
Keen	1
Senses	1
To	1
begin	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
monkeys	1
have	1
a	1
first-class	1
sensory	1
equipment,	1
especially	1
as	1
regards	1
sight,	1
hearing,	1
and	1
touch.	1
The	1
axes	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
eyes	1
are	1
directed	1
forwards	1
as	1
in	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
vision	1
is	1
common	1
to	1
both	1
eyes.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
monkeys	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
complete	1
stereoscopic	1
vision	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
mammals	1
enjoy.	1
They	1
look	1
more	1
and	1
smell	1
less.	1
They	1
can	1
distinguish	1
different	1
colours,	1
apart	1
from	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
brightness	1
in	1
the	1
coloured	1
objects.	1
They	1
are	1
quick	1
to	1
discriminate	1
differences	1
in	1
the	1
shapes	1
of	1
things,	1
e.g.	1
boxes	1
similar	1
in	1
size	1
but	1
different	1
in	1
shape,	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
prize	1
is	1
always	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
shape	1
they	1
soon	1
learn	1
(by	1
association)	1
to	1
select	1
the	1
profitable	1
one.	1
They	1
learn	1
to	1
discriminate	1
cards	1
with	1
short	1
words	1
or	1
with	1
signs	1
printed	1
on	1
them,	1
coming	1
down	1
when	1
the	1
"Yes"	1
card	1
is	1
shown,	1
remaining	1
on	1
their	1
perch	1
when	1
the	1
card	1
says	1
"No."	1
Bred	1
to	1
a	1
forest	1
life	1
where	1
alertness	1
is	1
a	1
life-or-death	1
quality,	1
they	1
are	1
quick	1
to	1
respond	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
movement	1
or	1
to	1
pick	1
out	1
some	1
new	1
feature	1
in	1
their	1
surroundings.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
vision	1
holds	1
also	1
for	1
hearing.	1
Power	1
of	1
Manipulation	1
Another	1
quality	1
which	1
separates	1
monkeys	1
very	1
markedly	1
from	1
ordinary	1
mammals	1
is	1
their	1
manipulative	1
expertness,	1
the	1
co-ordination	1
of	1
hand	1
and	1
eye.	1
This	1
great	1
gift	1
follows	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
among	1
monkeys	1
the	1
fore-leg	1
has	1
been	1
emancipated.	1
It	1
has	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
indispensable	1
as	1
an	1
organ	1
of	1
support;	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
climbing,	1
grasping,	1
lifting,	1
handling	1
organ.	1
The	1
fore-limb	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
free	1
hand,	1
and	1
everyone	1
who	1
knows	1
monkeys	1
at	1
all	1
is	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
zest	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
use	1
their	1
tool.	1
They	1
enjoy	1
pulling	1
things	1
to	1
pieces--a	1
kind	1
of	1
dissection--or	1
screwing	1
the	1
handle	1
off	1
a	1
brush	1
and	1
screwing	1
it	1
on	1
again.	1

_The	1
Expression	1
of	1
the	1
Emotions	1
in	1
Man	1
and	1
Animals_	1
(1872)	1
Charles	1
Darwin	1
showed	1
that	1
many	1
forms	1
of	1
facial	1
expression	1
familiar	1
in	1
man	1
have	1
their	1
counterparts	1
in	1
apes	1
and	1
other	1
mammals.	1
He	1
also	1
showed	1
how	1
important	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
expression	1
are	1
as	1
means	1
of	1
communication	1
between	1
mother	1
and	1
offspring,	1
mate	1
and	1
mate,	1
kith	1
and	1
kin.	1
The	1
anthropoid	1
apes	1
show	1
notable	1
differences	1
of	1
temperament	1
as	1
the	1
photographs	1
show.	1
The	1
chimpanzee	1
is	1
lively,	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
educable.	1
The	1
orang	1
is	1
also	1
mild	1
of	1
temper,	1
but	1
often	1
and	1
naturally	1
appears	1
melancholy	1
in	1
captivity.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
suggested,	1
however,	1
by	1
our	1
photograph	1
of	1
the	1
adult.	1
Both	1
chimpanzee	1
and	1
orang	1
are	1
markedly	1
contrasted	1

the	1
fierce	1

Activity	1
for	1
Activity's	1
Sake	1
Professor	1
Thorndike	1
hits	1
the	1
nail	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
when	1
he	1
lays	1
stress	1
on	1
the	1
intensity	1
of	1
activity	1
in	1
monkeys--activity	1
both	1
of	1
body	1
and	1
mind.	1
They	1
are	1
pent-up	1
reservoirs	1
of	1
energy,	1
which	1
almost	1
any	1
influence	1
will	1
tap.	1
Watch	1
a	1
cat	1
or	1
a	1
dog,	1
Professor	1
Thorndike	1
says;	1
it	1
does	1
comparatively	1
few	1
things	1
and	1
is	1
content	1
for	1
long	1
periods	1
to	1
do	1
nothing.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
splendidly	1
active	1
in	1
response	1
to	1
some	1
stimulus	1
such	1
as	1
food	1
or	1
a	1
friend	1
or	1
a	1
fight,	1
but	1
if	1
nothing	1
appeals	1
to	1
its	1
special	1
make-up,	1
which	1
is	1
very	1
utilitarian	1
in	1
its	1
interests,	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
nothing.	1
"Watch	1
a	1
monkey	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
enumerate	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
does,	1
cannot	1
discover	1
the	1
stimuli	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
reacts,	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
the	1
_raison	1
d'etre_	1
of	1
his	1
pursuits.	1
Everything	1
appeals	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
likes	1
to	1
be	1
active	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
activity."	1
This	1
applies	1
to	1
mental	1
activity	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
the	1
quality	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
extraordinary	1
interest,	1
for	1
it	1
shows	1
the	1
experimenting	1
mood	1
at	1
a	1
higher	1
turn	1
of	1
the	1
spiral	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
creature,	1
save	1
man.	1
It	1
points	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
scientific	1
spirit.	1
We	1
cannot,	1
indeed,	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
sudden	1
beginning	1
of	1
any	1
quality,	1
and	1
we	1
recall	1
the	1
experimenting	1
of	1
playing	1
mammals,	1
such	1
as	1
kids	1
and	1
kittens,	1
or	1
of	1
inquisitive	1
adults	1
like	1
Kipling's	1
mongoose,	1
Riki-Tiki-Tavi,	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
business	1
in	1
life	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
about	1
things.	1
But	1
in	1
monkeys	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
restless	1
experimenting	1
rises	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
pitch.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
curious	1
about	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
psychologist	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
quoted	1
tells	1
of	1
a	1
monkey	1
which	1
happened	1
to	1
hit	1
a	1
projecting	1
wire	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
vibrate.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
repeating	1
the	1
performance	1
hundreds	1
of	1
times	1
during	1
the	1
next	1
few	1
days.	1
Of	1
course,	1
he	1
got	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
save	1
fun,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
grist	1
to	1
his	1
mental	1
mill.	1
"The	1
fact	1
of	1
mental	1
life	1
is	1
to	1
monkeys	1
it	1
own	1
reward."	1
The	1
monkey's	1
brain	1
is	1
"tender	1
all	1
over,	1
functioning	1
throughout,	1
set	1
off	1
in	1
action	1
by	1
anything	1
and	1
everything."	1
Sheer	1
Quickness	1
Correlated	1
with	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
restless	1
inquisitiveness	1
and	1
delight	1
in	1
activity	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
quickness.	1
We	1
mean	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
locomotor	1
agility	1
that	1
marks	1
most	1
monkeys,	1
but	1
quickness	1
of	1
perception	1
and	1
plan.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
quality	1
that	1
life	1
among	1
the	1
branches	1
will	1
engender,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
neck	1
or	1
nothing.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
quality	1
which	1
we	1
describe	1
as	1
being	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
though	1
the	1
phrase	1
has	1
slipped	1
from	1
its	1
original	1
moorings.	1
Speaking	1
of	1
his	1
Bonnet	1
Monkey,	1
an	1
Indian	1
macaque,	1
second	1
cousin	1
to	1
the	1
kind	1
that	1
lives	1
on	1
the	1
Rock	1
of	1
Gibraltar,	1
Professor	1
S.	1
J.	1
Holmes	1
writes:	1
"For	1
keenness	1
of	1
perception,	1
rapidity	1
of	1
action,	1
facility	1
in	1
forming	1
good	1
practical	1
judgments	1
about	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
of	1
escaping	1
pursuit	1
and	1
of	1
attaining	1
various	1
other	1
ends,	1
Lizzie	1
had	1
few	1
rivals	1
in	1
the	1
animal	1
world....	1
Her	1
perceptions	1
and	1
decisions	1
were	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
rapid	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
frequently	1
transfer	1
her	1
attention,	1
decide	1
upon	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
action,	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
into	1
effect	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
about.	1
Until	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
her	1
nimble	1
and	1
unexpected	1
manoeuvres,	1
she	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
possession	1
of	1
many	1
apples	1
and	1
peanuts	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
intended	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
except	1
upon	1
the	1

Quick	1
to	1
Learn	1
Quite	1
fundamental	1
to	1
any	1
understanding	1
of	1
animal	1
behaviour	1
is	1
the	1
distinction	1
so	1
clearly	1
drawn	1
by	1
Sir	1
Ray	1
Lankester	1
between	1
the	1
"little-brain"	1
type,	1
rich	1
in	1
inborn	1
or	1
instinctive	1
capacities,	1
but	1
relatively	1
slow	1
to	1
learn,	1
and	1
the	1
"big-brain"	1
type,	1
with	1
a	1
relatively	1
poor	1
endowment	1
of	1
specialised	1
instincts,	1
but	1
with	1
great	1
educability.	1
The	1
"little-brain"	1
type	1
finds	1
its	1
climax	1
in	1
ants	1
and	1
bees;	1
the	1
"big-brain"	1
type	1
in	1
horses	1
and	1
dogs,	1
elephants	1
and	1
monkeys.	1
And	1
of	1
all	1
animals	1
monkeys	1
are	1
the	1
quickest	1
to	1
learn,	1
if	1
we	1
use	1
the	1
word	1
"learn"	1
to	1
mean	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
useful	1
associations	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
that,	1
between	1
a	1
given	1
sense-presentation	1
and	1
a	1
particular	1
piece	1
of	1
behaviour.	1
The	1
Case	1
of	1
Sally	1
Some	1
of	1
us	1
remember	1
Sally,	1
the	1
chimpanzee	1
at	1
the	1
"Zoo"	1
with	1
which	1
Dr.	1
Romanes	1
used	1
to	1
experiment.	1
She	1
was	1
taught	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
teacher	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
straws	1
he	1
asked	1
for,	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
learned	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
up	1
to	1
five.	1
If	1
she	1
handed	1
a	1
number	1
not	1
asked	1
for,	1
her	1
offer	1
was	1
refused;	1
if	1
she	1
gave	1
the	1
proper	1
number,	1
she	1
got	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
fruit.	1
If	1
she	1
was	1
asked	1
for	1
five	1
straws,	1
she	1
picked	1
them	1
up	1
individually	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
mouth,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gathered	1
five	1
she	1
presented	1
them	1
together	1
in	1
her	1
hand.	1
Attempts	1
to	1
teach	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
six	1
to	1
ten	1
straws	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
successful.	1
For	1
Sally	1
"above	1
six"	1
meant	1
"many,"	1
and	1
besides,	1
her	1
limits	1
of	1
patience	1
were	1
probably	1
less	1
than	1
her	1
range	1
of	1
computation.	1
This	1
was	1
hinted	1
at	1
by	1
the	1
highly	1
interesting	1
circumstance	1
that	1
when	1
dealing	1
with	1
numbers	1
above	1
five	1
she	1
very	1
frequently	1
doubled	1
over	1
a	1
straw	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
present	1
two	1
ends	1
and	1
thus	1
appear	1
as	1
two	1
straws.	1
The	1
doubling	1
of	1
the	1
straw	1
looked	1
like	1
an	1
intelligent	1
device	1
to	1
save	1
time,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
persistently	1
resorted	1
to	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
her	1
teacher	1
always	1
refused	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
doubled	1
straw	1
as	1
equivalent	1
to	1
two	1
straws.	1
Here	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
something	1
beyond	1
the	1
mere	1
association	1
of	1
a	1
sound--"Five"--and	1
that	1
number	1
of	1
straws.	1
The	1
Case	1
of	1
Lizzie	1
The	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
cage	1
in	1
which	1
Professor	1
Holmes	1
kept	1
Lizzie	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
vertical	1
bars	1
which	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
reach	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
arm.	1
On	1
a	1
board	1
with	1
an	1
upright	1
nail	1
as	1
handle,	1
there	1
was	1
placed	1
an	1
apple--out	1
of	1
Lizzie's	1
reach.	1
She	1
reached	1
immediately	1
for	1
the	1
nail,	1
pulled	1
the	1
board	1
in	1
and	1
got	1
the	1
apple.	1
"There	1
was	1
no	1
employment	1
of	1
the	1
method	1
of	1
trial	1
and	1
error;	1
there	1
was	1
direct	1
appropriate	1
action	1
following	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
her	1
relation	1
to	1
board,	1
nail,	1
and	1
apple."	1
Of	1
course	1
her	1
ancestors	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
adepts	1
at	1
drawing	1
a	1
fruit-laden	1
branch	1
within	1
their	1
reach,	1
but	1
the	1
simple	1
experiment	1
was	1
very	1
instructive.	1
All	1
the	1
more	1
instructive	1
because	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
cases	1
the	1
experiments	1
indicate	1
a	1
gradual	1
sifting	1
out	1
of	1
useless	1
movements	1
and	1
an	1
eventful	1
retention	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
pays.	1
When	1
Lizzie	1
was	1
given	1
a	1
vaseline	1
bottle	1
containing	1
a	1
peanut	1
and	1
closed	1
with	1
a	1
cork,	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
pulled	1
the	1
cork	1
out	1
with	1
her	1
teeth,	1
obeying	1
the	1
instinct	1
to	1
bite	1
at	1
new	1
objects,	1
but	1
she	1
never	1
learned	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
bottle	1
upside	1
down	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
nut	1
drop	1
out.	1
She	1
often	1
got	1
the	1
nut,	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
education	1
she	1
got	1
it	1
more	1
quickly	1
than	1
she	1
did	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
indication	1
that	1
she	1
ever	1
perceived	1
the	1
fit	1
and	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
what	1
she	1
wanted.	1
"In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
her	1
intent	1
efforts	1
her	1
mind	1
seemed	1
so	1
absorbed	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
desire	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
focussed	1
on	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
attaining	1
that	1
object.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
deliberation,	1
and	1
no	1
discrimination	1
between	1
the	1
important	1
and	1
the	1
unimportant	1
elements	1
in	1
her	1
behaviour.	1
The	1
gradually	1
increasing	1
facility	1
of	1
her	1
performances	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
apparently	1
unconscious	1
elimination	1
of	1
useless	1
movements."	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
learning,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
learning	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
level;	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
learning	1
by	1
ideas;	1
it	1
is	1
hardly	1
even	1
learning	1
by	1
experiment;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
learning	1
by	1
experience,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
fumbling	1
at	1
learning!	1
Trial	1
and	1
Error	1
A	1
higher	1
note	1
is	1
struck	1
in	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
some	1
more	1
highly	1
endowed	1
monkeys.	1
In	1
many	1
experiments,	1
chiefly	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
into	1
boxes	1
difficult	1
to	1
open,	1
there	1
is	1
evidence	1
(1)	1
of	1
attentive	1
persistent	1
experiment	1
(2)	1
of	1
the	1
rapid	1
elimination	1
of	1
ineffective	1
movements,	1
and	1
(3)	1
of	1
remembering	1
the	1
solution	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
discovered.	1
Kinnaman	1
taught	1
two	1
macaques	1
the	1
Hampton	1
Court	1
Maze,	1
a	1
feat	1
which	1
probably	1
means	1
a	1
memory	1
of	1
movements,	1
and	1
we	1
get	1
an	1
interesting	1
glimpse	1
in	1
his	1
observation	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
smack	1
their	1
lips	1
audibly	1
when	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
course,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
feel,	1
dare	1
one	1
say,	1
"We	1
are	1
right	1
this	1
time."	1
In	1
getting	1
into	1
"puzzle-boxes"	1
and	1
into	1
"combination-boxes"	1
(where	1
the	1
barriers	1
must	1
be	1
overcome	1
in	1
a	1
definite	1
order),	1
monkeys	1
learn	1
by	1
the	1
trial	1
and	1
error	1
method	1
much	1
more	1
quickly	1
than	1
cats	1
and	1
dogs	1
do,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
suggestive	1
fact	1
emphasized	1
by	1
Professor	1
Thorndike	1
is	1
"a	1
process	1
of	1
sudden	1
acquisition	1
by	1
a	1
rapid,	1
often	1
apparently	1
instantaneous	1
abandonment	1
of	1
the	1
unsuccessful	1
movements	1
and	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
appropriate	1
one,	1
which	1
rivals	1
in	1
suddenness	1
the	1
selections	1
made	1
by	1
human	1
beings	1
in	1
similar	1
performances."	1
A	1
higher	1
note	1
still	1
was	1
sounded	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
Thorndike's	1
monkeys	1
which	1
opened	1
a	1
puzzle-box	1
at	1
once,	1
eight	1
months	1
after	1
his	1
previous	1
experience	1
with	1
it.	1
For	1
here	1
was	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
registration	1
of	1
a	1
solution.	1
Imitation	1
Two	1
chimpanzees	1
in	1
the	1
Dublin	1
Zoo	1
were	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
washing	1
the	1
two	1
shelves	1
of	1
their	1
cupboard	1
and	1
"wringing"	1
the	1
wet	1
cloth	1
in	1
the	1
approved	1
fashion.	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
caricature	1
of	1
a	1
washerwoman,	1
and	1
someone	1
said,	1
"What	1
mimics	1
they	1
are!"	1
Now	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
that	1
was	1
or	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
the	1
chimpanzees,	1
but	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
experiments	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
do	1
not	1
lead	1
us	1
to	1
attach	1
to	1
imitation	1
so	1
much	1
importance	1
as	1
is	1
usually	1
given	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
popular	1
interpreter.	1
There	1
are	1
instances	1
where	1
a	1
monkey	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
a	1
puzzle	1
in	1
despair	1
returned	1
to	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
had	1
seen	1
its	1
neighbour	1
succeed,	1
but	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
experiments	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
creature	1
has	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
for	1
itself.	1
Even	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
simple	1
problem	1
as	1
drawing	1
food	1
near	1
with	1
a	1
stick,	1
it	1
often	1
seems	1
of	1
little	1
use	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
monkey	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
done.	1
Placing	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
food	1
outside	1
his	1
monkey's	1
cage,	1
Professor	1
Holmes	1
"poked	1
it	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
stick	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
suggestion	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
stick	1
might	1
be	1
employed	1
to	1
move	1
the	1
food	1
within	1
reach,	1
but	1
although	1
the	1
act	1
was	1
repeated	1
many	1
times	1
Lizzie	1
never	1
showed	1
the	1
least	1
inclination	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
stick	1
to	1
her	1
advantage."	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
"tool"	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
Bonnet	1
Monkey,	1
yet	1
here	1
again	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
cautious,	1
for	1
Professor	1
L.	1
T.	1
Hobhouse	1
had	1
a	1
monkey	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
macaque	1
genus	1
which	1
learned	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
use	1
a	1
crooked	1
stick	1
with	1
great	1
effect.	1
The	1
Case	1
of	1
Peter	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
cleverest	1
monkey	1
as	1
yet	1
studied	1
was	1
a	1
performing	1
chimpanzee	1
called	1
Peter,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
generally	1
described	1
by	1
Dr.	1
Lightner	1
Witmer.	1
Peter	1
could	1
skate	1
and	1
cycle,	1
thread	1
needles	1
and	1
untie	1
knots,	1
smoke	1
a	1
cigarette	1
and	1
string	1
beads,	1
screw	1
in	1
nails	1
and	1
unlock	1
locks.	1
But	1
what	1
Peter	1
was	1
thinking	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
to	1
guess,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
evidence	1
to	1
suggest	1
that	1
his	1
rapid	1
power	1
of	1
putting	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
together	1
ever	1
rose	1
above	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
concrete	1
mental	1
experimenting,	1
which	1
Dr.	1
Romanes	1
used	1
to	1
call	1
perceptual	1
inference.	1
Without	1
supposing	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
hard-and-fast	1
boundary	1
lines,	1
we	1
cannot	1
avoid	1
the	1
general	1
conclusion	1
that,	1
while	1
monkeys	1
are	1
often	1
intelligent,	1
they	1
seldom,	1
if	1
ever,	1
show	1
even	1
hints	1
of	1
reason,	1
i.e.	1
of	1
working	1
or	1
playing	1
with	1
general	1
ideas.	1
That	1
remains	1
Man's	1
prerogative.	1
The	1
Bustle	1
of	1
the	1
Mind	1
In	1
mammals	1
like	1
otters,	1
foxes,	1
stoats,	1
hares,	1
and	1
elephants,	1
what	1
a	1
complex	1
of	1
tides	1
and	1
currents	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
brain-mind!	1
We	1
may	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
stream	1
with	1
currents	1
at	1
different	1
levels.	1
Lowest	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
_basal	1
appetites_	1
of	1
hunger	1
and	1
sex,	1
often	1
with	1
eddies	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
surface.	1
Then	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
_primary	1
emotions_,	1
such	1
as	1
fear	1
of	1
hereditary	1
enemies	1
and	1
maternal	1
affection	1
for	1
offspring.	1
Above	1
these	1
are	1
_instinctive	1
aptitudes_,	1
inborn	1
powers	1
of	1
doing	1
clever	1
things	1
without	1
having	1
to	1
learn	1
how.	1
But	1
in	1
mammals	1
these	1
are	1
often	1
expressed	1
along	1
with,	1
or	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
through,	1
the	1
controlled	1
life	1
of	1
_intelligent	1
activity_,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
clear-cut	1
perceptual	1
influence.	1

COMMON	1
OTTER	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
resourceful	1
of	1
animals	1
and	1
the	1
"most	1
playsomest	1
crittur	1
on	1
God's	1
earth."	1
It	1
neither	1
stores	1
nor	1
hibernates,	1
but	1
survives	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
its	1
wits	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
careful	1
education	1
of	1
the	1
young.	1
The	1
otter	1
is	1
a	1
roving	1
animal,	1
often	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
resting-place;	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
travel	1
fifteen	1
miles	1
in	1

Higher	1
still	1
are	1
the	1
records	1

individual	1

multitude	1
of	1
messages	1
from	1
the	1
outside	1
world,	1
like	1
raindrops	1
and	1
hailstones	1
on	1
the	1
stream,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
penetrating	1
deeply,	1
being,	1
as	1
we	1
say,	1
full	1
of	1
meaning.	1
The	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
animal	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
like	1
a	1
child's	1
mind,	1
in	1
having	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
clear-cut	1
ideas,	1
in	1
showing	1
no	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
strict	1
sense,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
extraordinary	1
educability,	1
but	1
it	1
differs	1
from	1
the	1
child's	1
mind	1
entirely	1
in	1
the	1
sure	1
effectiveness	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
repertory	1
of	1
responses.	1
It	1
is	1
efficient	1
to	1
a	1
degree.	1
"Until	1
at	1
last	1
arose	1
the	1
Man."	1
Man's	1
brain	1
is	1
more	1
complicated	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
apes--gorilla,	1
orang,	1
and	1
chimpanzee--and	1
it	1
is	1
relatively	1
larger.	1
But	1
the	1
improvements	1
in	1
structure	1
do	1
not	1
seem	1
in	1
themselves	1
sufficient	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
man's	1
great	1
advance	1
in	1
intelligence.	1
The	1
rill	1
of	1
inner	1
life	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
swift	1
stream,	1
sometimes	1
a	1
rushing	1
torrent.	1
Besides	1
perceptual	1
inference	1
or	1
_Intelligence_--a	1
sort	1
of	1
picture-logic,	1
which	1
some	1
animals	1
likewise	1
have--there	1
is	1
conceptual	1
inference--or	1
_Reason_--an	1
internal	1
experimenting	1
with	1
general	1
ideas.	1
Even	1
the	1
cleverest	1
animals,	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
much	1
beyond	1
playing	1
with	1
"particulars";	1
man	1
plays	1
an	1
internal	1
game	1
of	1
chess	1
with	1
"universals."	1
Intelligent	1
behaviour	1
may	1
go	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
with	1
mental	1
images;	1
rational	1
conduct	1
demands	1
general	1
ideas.	1
It	1
may	1
be,	1
however,	1
that	1
"percepts"	1
and	1
"concepts"	1
differ	1
rather	1
in	1
degree	1
than	1
in	1
kind,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
passage	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
meant	1
a	1
higher	1
power	1
of	1
forming	1
associations.	1
A	1
clever	1
dog	1
has	1
probably	1
a	1
generalised	1
percept	1
of	1
man,	1
as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
a	1
memory-image	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
men	1
it	1
has	1
known,	1
but	1
man	1
alone	1
has	1
the	1
concept	1
Man,	1
or	1
Mankind,	1
or	1
Humanity.	1
Experimenting	1
with	1
concepts	1
or	1
general	1
ideas	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
Reason.	1
Here,	1
of	1
course,	1
we	1
get	1
into	1
deep	1
waters,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
wisest	1
not	1
to	1
attempt	1
too	1
much.	1
So	1
we	1
shall	1
content	1
ourselves	1
here	1
with	1
pointing	1
out	1
that	1
Man's	1
advance	1
in	1
intelligence	1
and	1
from	1
intelligence	1
to	1
reason	1
is	1
closely	1
wrapped	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
speech.	1
What	1
animals	1
began--a	1
small	1
vocabulary--he	1
has	1
carried	1
to	1
high	1
perfection.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
distinctive	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
vocabulary	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
making	1
sentences,	1
of	1
expressing	1
judgments	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
admitted	1
of	1
communication	1
between	1
mind	1
and	1
mind.	1
The	1
multiplication	1
of	1
words	1
meant	1
much,	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
words	1
as	1
symbols	1
of	1
general	1
ideas	1
meant	1
even	1
more,	1
for	1
it	1
meant	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
playing	1
the	1
internal	1
game	1
of	1
thinking;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
advance	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
comparing	1
notes	1
with	1
neighbours,	1
of	1
corroborating	1
individual	1
experience	1
by	1
social	1
intercourse.	1
With	1
words,	1
also,	1
it	1
became	1
easier	1
to	1
enregister	1
outside	1
himself	1
the	1
gains	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
significance	1
that	1
the	1
Greek	1
Logos,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
translated	1
"the	1
word,"	1
may	1
also	1
be	1
translated	1
Mind.	1
§	1
9	1
Looking	1
Backwards	1
When	1
we	1
take	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
animal	1
behaviour	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
long	1
inclined	1
plane.	1
The	1
outer	1
world	1
provokes	1
simple	1
creatures	1
to	1
answer	1
back;	1
simple	1
creatures	1
act	1
experimentally	1
on	1
their	1
surroundings.	1
From	1
the	1
beginning	1
this	1
twofold	1
process	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
on,	1
receiving	1
stimuli	1
from	1
the	1
environment	1
and	1
acting	1
upon	1
the	1
environment,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
efficiency	1
of	1
the	1
reactions	1
and	1
actions	1
living	1
creatures	1
have	1
been	1
sifted	1
for	1
millions	1
of	1
years.	1
One	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
advance	1
has	1
been	1
opening	1
new	1
gateways	1
of	1
knowledge--the	1
senses,	1
which	1
are	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
in	1
number.	1
The	1
other	1
main	1
line	1
of	1
advance	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
most	1
general	1
terms,	1
experimenting	1
or	1
testing,	1
probing	1
and	1
proving,	1
trying	1
one	1
key	1
after	1
another	1
till	1
a	1
door	1
is	1
unlocked.	1
There	1
is	1
progress	1
in	1
multiplying	1
the	1
gateways	1
of	1
knowledge	1
and	1
making	1
them	1
more	1
discriminating,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
progress	1
in	1
making	1
the	1
modes	1
of	1
experimenting	1
more	1
wide-awake,	1
more	1
controlled,	1
and	1
more	1
resolute.	1
But	1
behind	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
is	1
the	1
characteristically	1
vital	1
power	1
of	1
enregistering	1
within	1
the	1
organism	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
In	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
these	1
enregistrations	1
are	1
illustrated	1
by	1
memories	1
and	1
habituations	1
and	1
habits;	1
in	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
race	1
they	1
are	1
illustrated	1
by	1
reflex	1
actions	1
and	1
instinctive	1
capacities.	1
Body	1
and	1
Mind	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
shirk	1
the	1
very	1
difficult	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
the	1
bodily	1
and	1
the	1
mental	1
side	1
of	1
behaviour.	1
(_a_)	1
Some	1
great	1
thinkers	1
have	1
taught	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
is	1
a	1
reality	1
by	1
itself	1
which	1
plays	1
upon	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
the	1
brain	1
and	1
body.	1
As	1
the	1
instrument	1
gets	1
worn	1
and	1
dusty	1
the	1
playing	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
it	1
once	1
was,	1
but	1
the	1
player	1
is	1
still	1
himself.	1
This	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
one,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
it	1
when	1
applied	1
to	1
themselves	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
applied	1
to	1
other	1
intelligent	1
creatures	1
like	1
rooks	1
and	1
elephants.	1
It	1
may	1
be,	1
however,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
gradual	1
emancipation	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
which	1
has	1
gone	1
furthest	1
in	1
Man	1
and	1
is	1
still	1
progressing.	1
(_b_)	1
Some	1
other	1
thinkers	1
have	1
taught	1
that	1
the	1
inner	1
life	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
feeling	1
is	1
only,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
an	1
echo	1
of	1
the	1
really	1
important	1
activity--that	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
brain.	1
Ideas	1
are	1
just	1
foam-bells	1
on	1
the	1
hurrying	1
streams	1
and	1
circling	1
eddies	1
of	1
matter	1
and	1
energy	1
that	1
make	1
up	1
our	1
physiological	1
life.	1
To	1
most	1
of	1
us	1
this	1
theory	1
is	1
impossible,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
ideas	1
and	1
feelings	1
and	1
purposes,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
translated	1
into	1
matter	1
and	1
motion,	1
are	1
the	1
clearest	1
realities	1
in	1
our	1
experience,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
count	1
for	1
good	1
and	1
ill	1
all	1
through	1
our	1
life.	1
They	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
tickings	1
of	1
the	1
clock;	1
they	1
make	1
the	1
wheels	1
go	1
round.	1
(_c_)	1
There	1
are	1
others	1
who	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
scientific	1
position	1
is	1
simply	1
to	1
recognise	1
both	1
the	1
bodily	1
and	1
the	1
mental	1
activities	1
as	1
equally	1
important,	1
and	1
so	1
closely	1
interwoven	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
separated.	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
the	1
outer	1
and	1
the	1
inner	1
aspects	1
of	1
one	1
reality--the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
creature.	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
concave	1
and	1
convex	1
curves	1
of	1
a	1
dome,	1
like	1
the	1
two	1
sides	1
of	1
a	1
shield.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
organism	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
unity,	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
appearing	1
more	1
conspicuously	1
as	1
Mind-body,	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
as	1
Body-mind.	1
The	1
most	1
important	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
neither	1
aspect	1
can	1
be	1
left	1
out.	1
By	1
no	1
jugglery	1
with	1
words	1
can	1
we	1
get	1
Mind	1
out	1
of	1
Matter	1
and	1
Motion.	1
And	1
since	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
ourselves	1
quite	1
sure	1
of	1
our	1
Mind,	1
we	1
are	1
probably	1
safe	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
was	1
Mind.	1
This	1
is	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
Aristotle's	1
saying	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
also	1
in	1
kind	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
beginning--whatever	1
we	1
mean	1
by	1
beginning.	1
In	1
conclusion	1
What	1
has	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
truly	1
wonderful	1
result	1
which	1
we	1
admire	1
in	1
a	1
creature	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
or	1
an	1
otter,	1
a	1
horse	1
or	1
a	1
hare?	1
In	1
general,	1
we	1
may	1
say,	1
just	1
two	1
main	1
processes--(1)	1
testing	1
all	1
things,	1
and	1
(2)	1
holding	1
fast	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
good.	1
New	1
departures	1
occur	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
tested	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
worth.	1
Idiosyncrasies	1
crop	1
up	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
sifted.	1
New	1
cards	1
come	1
mysteriously	1
from	1
within	1
into	1
the	1
creature's	1
hand,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
played--for	1
better	1
or	1
for	1
worse.	1
So	1
by	1
new	1
variations	1
and	1
their	1
sifting,	1
by	1
experimenting	1
and	1
enregistering	1
the	1
results,	1
the	1
mind	1
has	1
gradually	1
evolved	1
and	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
evolve.	1
VIII	1
FOUNDATIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
UNIVERSE	1
THE	1
WORLD	1
OF	1
ATOMS	1
Most	1
people	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
oriental	1
race	1
which	1
puzzled	1
over	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
and	1
decided	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
supported	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
giant	1
elephant.	1
But	1
the	1
elephant?	1
They	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
monstrous	1
tortoise,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
end.	1
If	1
every	1
animal	1
in	1
nature	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
upon,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
nearer	1
a	1
foundation.	1
Most	1
ancient	1
peoples,	1
indeed,	1
made	1
no	1
effort	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
foundation.	1
The	1
universe	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
compact	1
little	1
structure,	1
mainly	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
canopy	1
over	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
sky.	1
They	1
left	1
it,	1
as	1
a	1
whole,	1
floating	1
in	1
nothing.	1
And	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
ancients	1
were	1
wiser	1
than	1
they	1
knew.	1
Things	1
do	1
not	1
fall	1
down	1
unless	1
they	1
are	1
pulled	1
down	1
by	1
that	1
mysterious	1
force	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
gravitation.	1
The	1
earth,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
is	1
pulled	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
would	1
fall	1
into	1
it;	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
escapes	1
this	1
fiery	1
fate	1
by	1
circulating	1
at	1
great	1
speed	1
round	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
stars	1
pull	1
each	1
other;	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
explained	1
that	1
they	1
meet	1
this	1
by	1
travelling	1
rapidly	1
in	1
gigantic	1
orbits.	1
Yet	1
we	1
do,	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
need	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
Our	1
mind	1
craves	1
for	1
some	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
made.	1
For	1
this	1
explanation	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
modern	1
Physics	1
and	1
Chemistry.	1
Both	1
these	1
sciences	1
study,	1
under	1
different	1
aspects,	1
matter	1
and	1
energy;	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
together	1
a	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
fundamental	1
nature	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
marks	1
an	1
epoch	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
human	1
thought.	1
§	1
1	1
The	1
Bricks	1
of	1
the	1
Cosmos	1
More	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
years	1
ago	1
the	1
first	1
men	1
of	1
science,	1
the	1
Greeks	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
Asia	1
Minor,	1
speculated	1
on	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
matter.	1
You	1
can	1
grind	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
stone	1
into	1
dust.	1
You	1
can	1
divide	1
a	1
spoonful	1
of	1
water	1
into	1
as	1
many	1
drops	1
as	1
you	1
like.	1
Apparently	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
on	1
dividing	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
apparatus	1
fine	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
work.	1
But	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
limit,	1
these	1
Greeks	1
said,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
supposed	1
that	1
all	1
matter	1
was	1
ultimately	1
composed	1
of	1
minute	1
particles	1
which	1
were	1
indivisible.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
Greek	1
word	1
"atom."	1
Like	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
ideas	1
of	1
these	1
brilliant	1
early	1
Greek	1
thinkers,	1
the	1
atom	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
conception.	1
We	1
know	1
to-day	1
that	1
matter	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
atoms.	1
But	1
science	1
was	1
then	1
so	1
young	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Greeks	1
applied	1
the	1
idea	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
profound.	1
A	1
liquid	1
or	1
a	1
gas,	1
they	1
said,	1
consisted	1
of	1
round,	1
smooth	1
atoms,	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
cling	1
together.	1
Then	1
there	1
were	1
atoms	1
with	1
rough	1
surfaces,	1
"hooky"	1
surfaces,	1
and	1
these	1
stuck	1
together	1
and	1
formed	1
solids.	1
The	1
atoms	1
of	1
iron	1
or	1
marble,	1
for	1
instance,	1
were	1
so	1
very	1
hooky	1
that,	1
once	1
they	1
got	1
together,	1
a	1
strong	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
tear	1
them	1
apart.	1
The	1
Greeks	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
was	1
that	1
an	1
infinite	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
atoms	1
had	1
been	1
moving	1
and	1
mixing	1
in	1
an	1
infinite	1
space	1
during	1
an	1
infinite	1
time,	1
and	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
hit	1
by	1
chance	1
on	1
the	1
particular	1
combination	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
universe.	1
This	1
was	1
too	1
simple	1
and	1
superficial.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
atoms	1
was	1
cast	1
aside,	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
advanced	1
again	1
in	1
various	1
ways.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
famous	1
Manchester	1
chemist,	1
John	1
Dalton,	1
who	1
restored	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
years	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century.	1
He	1
first	1
definitely	1
formulated	1
the	1
atomic	1
theory	1
as	1
a	1
scientific	1
hypothesis.	1
The	1
whole	1
physical	1
and	1
chemical	1
science	1
of	1
that	1
century	1
was	1
now	1
based	1
upon	1
the	1
atom,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
mistake	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
recent	1
discoveries	1
have	1
discredited	1
"atomism."	1
An	1
atom	1
is	1
the	1
smallest	1
particle	1
of	1
a	1
chemical	1
element.	1
No	1
one	1
has	1
ever	1
seen	1
an	1
atom.	1
Even	1
the	1
wonderful	1
new	1
microscope	1
which	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
invented	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
show	1
us	1
particles	1
of	1
matter	1
which	1
are	1
a	1
million	1
times	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
a	1
hair;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
atoms.	1
We	1
can	1
weigh	1
them	1
and	1
measure	1
them,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
invisible,	1
and	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
matter	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
discovery	1
that	1
atoms	1
are	1
not	1
indivisible.	1
They	1
consist	1
themselves	1
of	1
still	1
smaller	1
particles,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
see.	1
But	1
the	1
atoms	1
exist	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
we	1
may	1
still	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
bricks	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
material	1
universe	1
is	1
built.	1

But	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
some	1
magical	1
glass	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
into	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
material	1
things,	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
atoms	1
put	1
evenly	1
together	1
as	1
bricks	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
wall.	1
As	1
a	1
rule,	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
atoms	1
first	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
larger	1
particle,	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
"molecule."	1
Single	1
atoms	1
do	1
not,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
exist	1
apart	1
from	1
other	1
atoms;	1
if	1
a	1
molecule	1
is	1
broken	1
up,	1
the	1
individual	1
atoms	1
seek	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
other	1
atoms	1
of	1
another	1
kind	1
or	1
amongst	1
themselves.	1
For	1
example,	1
three	1
atoms	1
of	1
oxygen	1
form	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
ozone;	1
two	1
atoms	1
of	1
hydrogen	1
uniting	1
with	1
one	1
atom	1
of	1
oxygen	1
form	1
water.	1
It	1
is	1
molecules	1
that	1
form	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
matter;	1
a	1
molecule,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
expressed,	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
building	1
of	1
which	1
atoms	1
are	1
the	1
bricks.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
useful	1
first	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
material	1
things	1
we	1
handle.	1
In	1
a	1
liquid	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
the	1
liquid	1
cling	1
together	1
loosely.	1
They	1
remain	1
together	1
as	1
a	1
body,	1
but	1
they	1
roll	1
over	1
and	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
There	1
is	1
"cohesion"	1
between	1
them,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
less	1
powerful	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
solid.	1
Put	1
some	1
water	1
in	1
a	1
kettle	1
over	1
the	1
lighted	1
gas,	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
tiny	1
molecules	1
of	1
water	1
will	1
rush	1
through	1
the	1
spout	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
steam	1
and	1
scatter	1
over	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
The	1
heat	1
has	1
broken	1
their	1
bond	1
of	1
association	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
water	1
into	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
gas;	1
though	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
particles	1
will	1
come	1
together	1
again,	1
as	1
they	1
cool,	1
and	1
form	1
once	1
more	1
drops	1
of	1
water.	1
In	1
a	1
gas	1
the	1
molecules	1
have	1
full	1
individual	1
liberty.	1
They	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
violent	1
movement,	1
and	1
they	1
form	1
no	1
union	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
If	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
force	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
loose	1
sort	1
of	1
association	1
which	1
molecules	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
liquid,	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
slow	1
down	1
their	1
individual	1
movements	1
by	1
applying	1
severe	1
cold.	1
That	1
is	1
how	1
a	1
modern	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
liquefies	1
gases.	1
No	1
power	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
will	1
liquefy	1
air	1
at	1
its	1
ordinary	1
temperature.	1
In	1
_very_	1
severe	1
cold,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
air	1
will	1
spontaneously	1
become	1
liquid.	1
Some	1
day,	1
when	1
the	1
fires	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
have	1
sunk	1
very	1
low,	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
-200°	1
C.:	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
degrees	1
Centigrade	1
below	1
freezing-point.	1
It	1
will	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
moon.	1
Our	1
atmosphere	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
an	1
ocean	1
of	1
liquid	1
air,	1
35	1
feet	1
deep,	1
lying	1
upon	1
the	1
solidly	1
frozen	1
masses	1
of	1
our	1
water-oceans.	1
In	1
a	1
solid	1
the	1
molecules	1
cling	1
firmly	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
We	1
need	1
a	1
force	1
equal	1
to	1
twenty-five	1
tons	1
to	1
tear	1
asunder	1
the	1
molecules	1
in	1
a	1
bar	1
of	1
iron	1
an	1
inch	1
thick.	1
Yet	1
the	1
structure	1
is	1
not	1
"solid"	1
in	1
the	1
popular	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
If	1
you	1
put	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
solid	1
gold	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
pool	1
of	1
mercury,	1
the	1
gold	1
will	1
take	1
in	1
the	1
mercury	1
_between_	1
its	1
molecules,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
porous	1
like	1
a	1
sponge.	1
The	1
hardest	1
solid	1
is	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
lattice-work	1
than	1
what	1
we	1
usually	1
mean	1
by	1
"solid";	1
though	1
the	1
molecules	1
are	1
not	1
fixed,	1
like	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
a	1
lattice-work,	1
but	1
are	1
in	1
violent	1
motion;	1
they	1
vibrate	1
about	1
equilibrium	1
positions.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
right	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
hardest	1
steel,	1
we	1
should	1
see	1
billions	1
of	1
separate	1
molecules,	1
at	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
all	1
moving	1
rapidly	1
to	1
and	1
fro.	1
This	1
molecular	1
movement	1
can,	1
in	1
a	1
measure,	1
be	1
made	1
visible.	1
It	1
was	1
noticed	1
by	1
a	1
microscopist	1
named	1
Brown	1
that,	1
in	1
a	1
solution	1
containing	1
very	1
fine	1
suspended	1
particles,	1
the	1
particles	1
were	1
in	1
constant	1
movement.	1
Under	1
a	1
powerful	1
microscope	1
these	1
particles	1
are	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
violently	1
agitated;	1
they	1
are	1
each	1
independently	1
darting	1
hither	1
and	1
thither	1
somewhat	1
like	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
billiard	1
balls	1
on	1
a	1
billiard	1
table,	1
colliding	1
and	1
bounding	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
directions.	1
Thousands	1
of	1
times	1
a	1
second	1
these	1
encounters	1
occur,	1
and	1
this	1
lively	1
commotion	1
is	1
always	1
going	1
on,	1
this	1
incessant	1
colliding	1
of	1
one	1
molecule	1
with	1
another	1
is	1
the	1
normal	1
condition	1
of	1
affairs;	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
at	1
rest.	1
The	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
worked	1
out,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
known	1
that	1
these	1
particles	1
move	1
about	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
being	1
incessantly	1
bombarded	1
by	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
the	1
liquid.	1
The	1
molecules	1
cannot,	1
of	1
course,	1
be	1
seen,	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
their	1
incessant	1
movement	1
is	1
revealed	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
by	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
visible	1
suspended	1
particles.	1
This	1
incessant	1
movement	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
molecules	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Brownian	1
movement,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
striking	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
molecular	1
motions.	1
§	1

The	1
Wonder-World	1
of	1
Atoms	1
The	1
exploration	1
of	1
this	1
wonder-world	1
of	1
atoms	1
and	1
molecules	1
by	1
the	1
physicists	1
and	1
chemists	1
of	1
to-day	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
impressive	1
triumphs	1
of	1
modern	1
science.	1
Quite	1
apart	1
from	1
radium	1
and	1
electrons	1
and	1
other	1
sensational	1
discoveries	1
of	1
recent	1
years,	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
ordinary	1
matter	1
is	1
hardly	1
inferior,	1
either	1
in	1
interest	1
or	1
audacity,	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
astronomer.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
foundation	1
in	1
both	1
cases--marvellous	1
apparatus,	1
and	1
trains	1
of	1
mathematical	1
reasoning	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
astonished	1
Euclid	1
or	1
Archimedes.	1
Extraordinary,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
figures	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
minuteness	1
of	1
atoms	1
and	1
molecules,	1
let	1
us	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
owe	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
solid	1
and	1
severe	1
processes	1
of	1
human	1
thought.	1
Yet	1
the	1
principle	1
can	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
be	1
made	1
so	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
reader	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
take	1
much	1
on	1
trust.	1
It	1
is,	1
for	1
instance,	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
common	1
knowledge	1
that	1
gold	1
is	1
soft	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
beaten	1
into	1
gold	1
leaf.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
common	1
sense,	1
one	1
hopes,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
beat	1
a	1
measured	1
cube	1
of	1
gold	1
into	1
a	1
leaf	1
six	1
inches	1
square,	1
the	1
mathematician	1
can	1
tell	1
the	1
thickness	1
of	1
that	1
leaf	1
without	1
measuring	1
it.	1
As	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
a	1
single	1
grain	1
of	1
gold	1
has	1
been	1
beaten	1
into	1
a	1
leaf	1
seventy-five	1
inches	1
square.	1
Now	1
the	1
mathematician	1
can	1
easily	1
find	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
single	1
grain	1
of	1
gold	1
is	1
beaten	1
out	1
to	1
that	1
size,	1
the	1
leaf	1
must	1
be	1
1/367,000	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
thick,	1
or	1
about	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
thinner	1
than	1
the	1
paper	1
on	1
which	1
these	1
words	1
are	1
printed;	1
yet	1
the	1
leaf	1
must	1
be	1
several	1
molecules	1
thick.	1
The	1
finest	1
gold	1
leaf	1
is,	1
in	1
fact,	1
too	1
thick	1
for	1
our	1
purpose,	1
and	1
we	1
turn	1
with	1
a	1
new	1
interest	1
to	1
that	1
toy	1
of	1
our	1
boyhood	1
the	1
soap-bubble.	1
If	1
you	1
carefully	1
examine	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
delicate	1
films	1
of	1
soapy	1
water,	1
you	1
notice	1
certain	1
dark	1
spots	1
or	1
patches	1
on	1
them.	1
These	1
are	1
their	1
thinnest	1
parts,	1
and	1
by	1
two	1
quite	1
independent	1
methods--one	1
using	1
electricity	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
light--we	1
have	1
found	1
that	1
at	1
these	1
spots	1
the	1
bubble	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
three-millionth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
thick!	1
But	1
the	1
molecules	1
in	1
the	1
film	1
cling	1
together	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
thinnest	1
part.	1
A	1
molecule,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
be	1
far	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
three-millionth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
thick.	1
We	1
found	1
next	1
that	1
a	1
film	1
of	1
oil	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
water	1
may	1
be	1
even	1
thinner	1
than	1
a	1
soap-bubble.	1
Professor	1
Perrin,	1
the	1
great	1
French	1
authority	1
on	1
atoms,	1
got	1
films	1
of	1
oil	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
fifty-millionth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
thickness!	1
He	1
poured	1
a	1
measured	1
drop	1
of	1
oil	1
upon	1
water.	1
Then	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
exact	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
area	1
of	1
the	1
oil-sheet	1
by	1
blowing	1
upon	1
the	1
water	1
a	1
fine	1
powder	1
which	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
and	1
clearly	1
outlined	1
it.	1
The	1
rest	1
is	1
safe	1
and	1
simple	1
calculation,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
beaten	1
grain	1
of	1
gold.	1
Now	1
this	1
film	1
of	1
oil	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
molecules	1
deep,	1
so	1
a	1
single	1
molecule	1
of	1
oil	1
is	1
considerably	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
hundred-millionth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
diameter.	1
Innumerable	1
methods	1
have	1
been	1
tried,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
same.	1
A	1
single	1
grain	1
of	1
indigo,	1
for	1
instance,	1
will	1
colour	1
a	1
ton	1
of	1
water.	1
This	1
obviously	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
grain	1
contains	1
billions	1
of	1
molecules	1
which	1
spread	1
through	1
the	1
water.	1
A	1
grain	1
of	1
musk	1
will	1
scent	1
a	1
room--pour	1
molecules	1
into	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
it--for	1
several	1
years,	1
yet	1
not	1
lose	1
one-millionth	1
of	1
its	1
mass	1
in	1
a	1
year.	1
There	1
are	1
a	1
hundred	1
ways	1
of	1
showing	1
the	1
minuteness	1
of	1
the	1
ultimate	1
particles	1
of	1
matter,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
give	1
definite	1
figures.	1
On	1
a	1
careful	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
methods	1
we	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
average	1
molecule	1
of	1
matter	1
is	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
1/125,000,000	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
diameter.	1
In	1
a	1
single	1
cubic	1
centimetre	1
of	1
air--a	1
globule	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
marble--there	1
are	1
thirty	1
million	1
trillion	1
molecules.	1
And	1
since	1
the	1
molecule	1
is,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
a	1
group	1
or	1
cluster	1
of	1
atoms,	1
the	1
atom	1
itself	1
is	1
smaller.	1
Atoms,	1
for	1
reasons	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
later,	1
differ	1
very	1
greatly	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
size	1
and	1
weight.	1
It	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
400,000,000	1
of	1
them,	1
in	1
a	1
line,	1
to	1
cover	1
an	1
inch	1
of	1
space;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
takes	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
quintillion	1
atoms	1
of	1
gold	1
to	1
weigh	1
a	1
single	1
gramme.	1
Five	1
million	1
atoms	1
of	1
helium	1
could	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
across	1
the	1
diameter	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
stop.	1

Two	1
or	1
more	1
atoms	1
come	1
together	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
molecule:	1
thus	1
molecules	1
form	1
the	1

The	1
Energy	1
of	1
Atoms	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
only	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
wonders	1
that	1
were	1
done	1
with	1
"ordinary	1
matter,"	1
quite	1
apart	1
from	1
radium	1
and	1
its	1
revelations,	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
presently.	1
Most	1
people	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
"atomic	1
energy,"	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
things	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
accomplished	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
harness	1
this	1
energy	1
and	1
turn	1
it	1
to	1
human	1
use.	1
A	1
deeper	1
and	1
more	1
wonderful	1
source	1
of	1
this	1
energy	1
has	1
been	1
discovered	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
twenty	1
years,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
to	1
realise	1
that	1
the	1
atoms	1
themselves	1
have	1
stupendous	1
energy.	1
The	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter	1
are	1
vibrating	1
or	1
gyrating	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
vigour.	1
The	1
piece	1
of	1
cold	1
iron	1
you	1
hold	1
in	1
your	1
hand,	1
the	1
bit	1
of	1
brick	1
you	1
pick	1
up,	1
or	1
the	1
penny	1
you	1
take	1
from	1
your	1
pocket	1
is	1
a	1
colossal	1
reservoir	1
of	1
energy,	1
since	1
it	1
consists	1
of	1
trillions	1
of	1
moving	1
atoms.	1
To	1
realise	1
the	1
total	1
energy,	1
of	1
course,	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
witness	1
a	1
transformation	1
such	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
in	1
atoms	1
of	1
radio-active	1
elements,	1
about	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
presently.	1
If	1
we	1
put	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
indigo	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
water,	1
or	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
musk	1
in	1
a	1
perfectly	1
still	1
room,	1
we	1
soon	1
realise	1
that	1
molecules	1
travel.	1
Similarly,	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
gases	1
spread	1
until	1
they	1
fill	1
every	1
"empty"	1
available	1
space	1
shows	1
definitely	1
that	1
they	1
consist	1
of	1
small	1
particles	1
travelling	1
at	1
great	1
speed.	1
The	1
physicist	1
brings	1
his	1
refined	1
methods	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
he	1
measures	1
the	1
energy	1
and	1
velocity	1
of	1
these	1
infinitely	1
minute	1
molecules.	1
He	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
molecules	1
of	1
oxygen,	1
at	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
melting	1
ice,	1
travel	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
about	1
500	1
yards	1
a	1
second--more	1
than	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
a	1
second.	1
Molecules	1
of	1
hydrogen	1
travel	1
at	1
four	1
times	1
that	1
speed,	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
the	1
speed	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
bullet	1
leaves	1
a	1
rifle.	1
Each	1
molecule	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
which	1
seems	1
so	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
a	1
summer's	1
day,	1
is	1
really	1
travelling	1
faster	1
than	1
a	1
rifle	1
bullet	1
does	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
its	1
journey.	1
It	1
collides	1
with	1
another	1
molecule	1
every	1
twenty-thousandth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
of	1
its	1
journey.	1
It	1
is	1
turned	1
from	1
its	1
course	1
5,000,000,000	1
times	1
in	1
every	1
second	1
by	1
collisions.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
stop	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
hydrogen	1
gas,	1
and	1
utilise	1
their	1
energy,	1
as	1
we	1
utilise	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
steam	1
or	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
at	1
Niagara,	1
we	1
should	1
find	1
enough	1
in	1
every	1
gramme	1
of	1
gas	1
(about	1
two-thousandths	1
of	1
a	1
pound)	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
a	1
ton	1
to	1
a	1
height	1
of	1
forty	1
inches.	1
I	1
have	1
used	1
for	1
comparison	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
a	1
rifle	1
bullet,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
earlier	1
generation	1
people	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
impossible	1
even	1
to	1
estimate	1
this.	1
It	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
easy.	1
We	1
put	1
two	1
screens	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
the	1
bullet,	1
one	1
near	1
the	1
rifle	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
some	1
distance	1
away.	1
We	1
connect	1
them	1
electrically	1
and	1
use	1
a	1
fine	1
time-recording	1
machine,	1
and	1
the	1
bullet	1
itself	1
registers	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
takes	1
to	1
travel	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
screen.	1
Now	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
simple	1
and	1
superficial	1
work	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
exact	1
and	1
minute	1
measurements	1
which	1
the	1
physicist	1
and	1
chemist	1
use.	1
In	1

exactly	1
equal	1
pieces	1
of	1

in	1
the	1
opposite	1

word	1
has	1
been	1

these	1

that	1
little	1
scraping	1
of	1
lead	1
has	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
scale!	1
The	1
spectroscope	1
will	1
detect	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
matter	1
four	1
million	1
times	1
smaller	1
even	1
than	1
this;	1
and	1
the	1
electroscope	1
is	1
a	1
million	1
times	1
still	1
more	1
sensitive	1
than	1
the	1
spectroscope.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
heat-measuring	1
instrument,	1
the	1
bolometer,	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
best	1
thermometer	1
seem	1
Early	1

It	1
records	1
the	1

of	1
a	1

of	1
temperature.	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
instruments,	1
multiplied	1
by	1
the	1
score,	1
which	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
the	1

the	1
electron.	1
Another	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
phase	1
of	1
our	1
exploration	1
of	1
the	1
material	1
universe	1
opened	1
with	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radium	1
in	1
1898.	1
In	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radio-active	1
elements,	1
a	1
new	1
property	1
of	1
matter	1
was	1
discovered.	1
What	1
followed	1
on	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radium	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
X-rays	1
we	1
shall	1
see.	1
As	1
Sir	1
Ernest	1
Rutherford,	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
greatest	1
authorities,	1
recently	1
said,	1
the	1
new	1
physics	1
has	1
dissipated	1
the	1
last	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
atoms	1
and	1
molecules.	1
The	1
closer	1
examination	1
of	1
matter	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
shows	1
positively	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
atoms.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
word	1
now	1
in	1
its	1
original	1
Greek	1
meaning	1
(an	1
"indivisible"	1
thing).	1
The	1
atoms	1
are	1
not	1
indivisible.	1
They	1
can	1
be	1
broken	1
up.	1
They	1
are	1
composed	1
of	1
still	1
smaller	1
particles.	1
The	1
discovery	1
that	1
the	1
atom	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
smaller	1
particles	1
was	1
the	1
welcome	1
realisation	1
of	1
a	1
dream	1
that	1
had	1
haunted	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century.	1
Chemists	1
said	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
about	1
eighty	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
atoms--different	1
kinds	1
of	1
matter--but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
multiplicity.	1
Science	1
is	1
always	1
aiming	1
at	1
simplicity	1
and	1
unity.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
science	1
has	1
now	1
taken	1
a	1
long	1
step	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
explaining	1
the	1
fundamental	1
unity	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
chemist	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
these	1
"elements"	1
into	1
something	1
simpler,	1
so	1
he	1
called	1
their	1
atoms	1
"indivisible"	1
in	1
that	1
sense.	1
But	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
after	1
another	1
expressed	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
yet	1
discover	1
some	1
fundamental	1
matter	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
various	1
atoms	1
were	1
composed--_one	1
primordial	1
substance	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
varying	1
forms	1
of	1
matter	1
have	1
been	1
evolved	1
or	1
built	1
up_.	1
Prout	1
suggested	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
century,	1
when	1
atoms	1
were	1
rediscovered	1
by	1
Dalton.	1
Father	1
Secchi,	1
the	1
famous	1
Jesuit	1
astronomer	1
said	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
atoms	1
were	1
probably	1
evolved	1
from	1
ether;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
favoured	1
speculation.	1
Sir	1
William	1
Crookes	1
talked	1
of	1
"prothyl"	1
as	1
the	1
fundamental	1
substance.	1
Others	1
thought	1
hydrogen	1
was	1
the	1
stuff	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
atoms	1
were	1
composed.	1
The	1
work	1
which	1
finally	1
resulted	1
in	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radium	1
began	1
with	1
some	1
beautiful	1
experiments	1
of	1
Professor	1
(later	1
Sir	1
William)	1
Crookes	1
in	1
the	1
eighties.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
noticed	1
in	1
1869	1
that	1
a	1
strange	1
colouring	1
was	1
caused	1
when	1
an	1
electric	1
charge	1
was	1
sent	1
through	1
a	1
vacuum	1
tube--the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
glass	1
tube	1
began	1
to	1
glow	1
with	1
a	1
greenish	1
phosphorescence.	1
A	1
vacuum	1
tube	1
is	1
one	1
from	1
which	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
air	1
has	1
been	1
pumped,	1
although	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
completely	1
empty	1
the	1
tube.	1
Crookes	1
used	1
such	1
ingenious	1
methods	1
that	1
he	1
reduced	1
the	1
gas	1
in	1
his	1
tubes	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
twenty	1
million	1
times	1
thinner	1
than	1
the	1
atmosphere.	1
He	1
then	1
sent	1
an	1
electric	1
discharge	1
through,	1
and	1
got	1
very	1
remarkable	1
results.	1
The	1
negative	1
pole	1
of	1
the	1
electric	1
current	1
(the	1
"cathode")	1
_gave	1
off	1
rays	1
which	1
faintly	1
lit	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
the	1
thin	1
gas	1
in	1
the	1
tube_,	1
and	1
caused	1
a	1
pretty	1
fluorescence	1
on	1
the	1
glass	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
tube.	1
What	1
were	1
these	1
Rays?	1
Crookes	1
at	1
first	1
thought	1
they	1
corresponded	1
to	1
a	1
"new	1
or	1
fourth	1
state	1
of	1
matter."	1
Hitherto	1
we	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
familiar	1
with	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
conditions	1
of	1
solid,	1
liquid,	1
and	1
gaseous.	1
Now	1
Crookes	1
really	1
had	1
the	1
great	1
secret	1
under	1
his	1
eyes.	1
But	1
about	1
twenty	1
years	1
elapsed	1
before	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
these	1
rays	1
was	1
finally	1
and	1
independently	1
established	1
by	1
various	1
experiments.	1
The	1
experiments	1
proved	1
"that	1
the	1
rays	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
negatively	1
charged	1
particles	1
travelling	1
with	1
enormous	1
velocities	1
from	1
10,000	1
to	1
100,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
In	1
addition,	1
it	1
was	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
each	1
particle	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
small,	1
about	1
1/1800	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
a	1
hydrogen	1
atom,	1
the	1
lightest	1
atom	1
known	1
to	1
science."	1
_These	1
particles	1
or	1
electrons,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
called,	1
were	1
being	1
liberated	1
from	1
the	1
atom._	1
The	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter	1
were	1
breaking	1
down	1
in	1
Crookes	1
tubes.	1
At	1
that	1
time,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
premature	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
and	1
Crookes	1
preferred	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
particles	1
of	1
the	1
gas	1
were	1
electrified	1
and	1
hurled	1
against	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
tube.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ordinary	1
matter	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
state--"radiant	1
matter."	1
Another	1
distinguished	1
man	1
of	1
science,	1
Lenard,	1
found	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
fitted	1
a	1
little	1
plate	1
of	1
aluminum	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
tube,	1
the	1
mysterious	1
rays	1
passed	1
through	1
this	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
window.	1
They	1
must	1
be	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
ether,	1
he	1
said.	1

The	1
Discovery	1
of	1
X-rays	1
So	1
the	1
story	1
went	1
on	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
led.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
next	1
great	1
step	1
was	1
when,	1
in	1
1895,	1
Röen	1
discovered	1
the	1
X-rays,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
known	1
to	1
everybody.	1
He	1
was	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Lenard,	1
and	1
he	1
one	1
day	1
covered	1
a	1
"Crookes	1
tube"	1
with	1
some	1
black	1
stuff.	1
To	1
his	1
astonishment	1
a	1
prepared	1
chemical	1
screen	1
which	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
tube	1
began	1
to	1
glow.	1
_The	1
rays	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
black	1
stuff;	1
and	1
on	1
further	1
experiment	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
stone,	1
living	1
flesh,	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
"opaque"	1
substances._	1
In	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
astonished	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
we	1
could	1
photograph	1
the	1
skeleton	1
in	1
a	1
living	1
man's	1
body,	1
locate	1
a	1
penny	1
in	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
a	1
child	1
that	1
had	1
swallowed	1
one,	1
or	1
take	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
a	1
coin	1
through	1
a	1
slab	1
of	1
stone.	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
these	1
X-rays?	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
matter;	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
material	1
particles.	1
X-rays	1
were	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
new	1
variety	1
of	1
_light_	1
with	1
a	1
remarkable	1
power	1
of	1
penetration.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
reveals	1
about	1
the	1
varying	1
nature	1
of	1
light	1
wave-lengths.	1
Light-waves	1
are	1
set	1
up	1
by	1
vibrations	1
in	1
ether,[2]	1
and,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
see,	1
these	1
ether	1
disturbances	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind;	1
they	1
only	1
differ	1
as	1
regards	1
wave-lengths.	1
The	1
X-rays	1
which	1
Röen	1
discovered,	1
then,	1
are	1
light,	1
but	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
light	1
previously	1
unknown	1
to	1
us;	1
they	1
are	1
ether	1
waves	1
of	1
very	1
short	1
length.	1
X-rays	1
have	1
proved	1
of	1
great	1
value	1
in	1
many	1
directions,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
discuss	1
at	1
this	1
point.	1
Let	1
us	1
see	1
what	1
followed	1
Röen's	1
discovery.	1
[2]	1
We	1
refer	1
throughout	1
to	1
the	1
"ether"	1
because,	1
although	1
modern	1
theories	1
dispense	1
largely	1
with	1
this	1
conception,	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
physics	1
are	1
so	1
inextricably	1
interwoven	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
necessary,	1
in	1
an	1
elementary	1
exposition,	1
to	1
assume	1
its	1
existence.	1
The	1
modern	1
view	1
will	1
be	1
explained	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
on	1
Einstein's	1
Theory.	1
While	1
the	1
world	1
wondered	1
at	1
these	1
marvels,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
were	1
eagerly	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
new	1
clue	1
to	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
matter	1
which	1
was	1
exercising	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Crookes	1
and	1
other	1
investigators.	1
In	1
1896	1
Becquerel	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
discovery.	1
Certain	1
substances	1
are	1
phosphorescent--they	1
become	1
luminous	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
sunlight	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
Becquerel	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
substances	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
X-rays.	1
One	1
day	1
he	1
chose	1
a	1
salt	1
of	1
the	1
metal	1
uranium.	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
if,	1
after	1
exposing	1
it	1
to	1
sunlight,	1
he	1
could	1
photograph	1
a	1
cross	1
with	1
it	1
through	1
an	1
opaque	1
substance.	1
He	1
wrapped	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
aside,	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
sun,	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
uranium	1
salt	1
did	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
sun.	1
Some	1
strong	1
radiation	1
from	1
it	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
opaque	1
covering	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
the	1
cross	1
upon	1
the	1
plate	1
underneath.	1
Light	1
or	1
darkness	1
was	1
immaterial.	1
The	1
mysterious	1
rays	1
streamed	1
night	1
and	1
day	1
from	1
the	1
salt.	1
This	1
was	1
something	1
new.	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
substance	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
producing	1
X-rays;	1
the	1
rays	1
emitted	1
by	1
uranium	1
would	1
penetrate	1
the	1
same	1
opaque	1
substances	1
as	1
the	1
X-rays	1
discovered	1
by	1
Röen.	1
Discovery	1
of	1
Radium	1
Now,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
many	1
other	1
investigators,	1
Professor	1
Curie	1
and	1
his	1
Polish	1
wife	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
search.	1
They	1
decided	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whether	1
the	1
emission	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
uranium	1
itself	1
or	1
_from	1
something	1
associated	1
with	1
it_,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
chemical	1
analysis	1
of	1
great	1
quantities	1
of	1
minerals.	1
They	1
found	1
a	1
certain	1
kind	1
of	1
pitchblende	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
active,	1
and	1
they	1
analysed	1
tons	1
of	1
it,	1
concentrating	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
radiant	1
element	1
in	1
it.	1
After	1
a	1
time,	1
as	1
they	1
successively	1
worked	1
out	1
the	1
non-radiant	1
matter,	1
the	1
stuff	1
began	1
to	1
glow.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
extracted	1
from	1
eight	1
tons	1
of	1
pitchblende	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
teaspoonful	1
of	1
something	1
_that	1
was	1
a	1
million	1
times	1
more	1
radiant	1
than	1
uranium_.	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
name	1
for	1
it--Radium.	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
starting-point	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
development	1
of	1
physics	1
and	1
chemistry.	1
From	1
every	1
laboratory	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
came	1
a	1
cry	1
for	1
radium	1
salts	1
(as	1
pure	1
radium	1
was	1
too	1
precious),	1
and	1
hundreds	1
of	1
brilliant	1
workers	1
fastened	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
element.	1
The	1
inquiry	1
was	1
broadened,	1
and,	1
as	1
year	1
followed	1
year,	1
one	1
substance	1
after	1
another	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
emitting	1
rays,	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
radio-active.	1
We	1
know	1
to-day	1
that	1
nearly	1
every	1
form	1
of	1
matter	1
can	1
be	1
stimulated	1
to	1
radio-activity;	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
see,	1
means	1
that	1
_its	1
atoms	1
break	1
up	1
into	1
smaller	1
and	1
wonderfully	1
energetic	1
particles	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
"electrons."_	1
This	1
discovery	1
of	1
electrons	1
has	1
brought	1
about	1
a	1
complete	1
change	1
in	1
our	1
ideas	1
in	1
many	1
directions.	1
So,	1
instead	1
of	1
atoms	1
being	1
indivisible,	1
they	1
are	1
actually	1
dividing	1
themselves,	1
spontaneously,	1
and	1
giving	1
off	1
throughout	1
the	1
universe	1
tiny	1
fragments	1
of	1
their	1
substance.	1
We	1
shall	1
explain	1
presently	1
what	1
was	1
later	1
discovered	1
about	1
the	1
electron;	1
meanwhile	1
we	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
every	1
glowing	1
metal	1
is	1
pouring	1
out	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
these	1
electrons.	1
Every	1
arc-lamp	1
is	1
discharging	1
them.	1
Every	1
clap	1
of	1
thunder	1
means	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
them.	1
Every	1
star	1
is	1
flooding	1
space	1
with	1
them.	1
We	1
are	1
witnessing	1
the	1
spontaneous	1
breaking	1
up	1
of	1
atoms,	1
atoms	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
indivisible.	1
The	1
sun	1
not	1
only	1
pours	1
out	1
streams	1
of	1
electrons	1
from	1
its	1
own	1
atoms,	1
but	1
the	1
ultra-violet	1
light	1
which	1
it	1
sends	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
agencies	1
for	1
releasing	1
electrons	1
from	1
the	1
surface-atoms	1
of	1
matter	1
on	1
the	1
earth.	1
It	1
is	1
fortunate	1
for	1
us	1
that	1
our	1
atmosphere	1
absorbs	1
most	1
of	1
this	1
ultra-violet	1
or	1
invisible	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun--a	1
kind	1
of	1
light	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
explained	1
presently.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
suggested	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
received	1
the	1
full	1
flood	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
sun,	1
our	1
metals	1
would	1
disintegrate	1
under	1
its	1
influence	1
and	1
this	1
"steel	1
civilisation"	1
of	1
ours	1
would	1
be	1
impossible!	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
here	1
anticipating,	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
beyond	1
radium	1
to	1
the	1
wonderful	1
discoveries	1
which	1
were	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
chemists	1
and	1
physicists	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
it.	1
The	1
work	1
of	1
Professor	1
and	1
Mme.	1
Curie	1
was	1
merely	1
the	1
final	1
clue	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
great	1
search.	1
How	1
it	1
was	1
followed	1
up,	1
how	1
we	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
minute	1
atom	1
and	1
discovered	1
new	1
and	1
portentous	1
mines	1
of	1
energy,	1
and	1
how	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
understand,	1
not	1
only	1
matter,	1
but	1
electricity	1
and	1
light,	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
chapter.	1
THE	1
DISCOVERY	1
OF	1
THE	1
ELECTRON	1
AND	1
HOW	1
IT	1
EFFECTED	1
A	1
REVOLUTION	1
IN	1
IDEAS	1
What	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radium	1
implied	1
was	1
only	1
gradually	1
realised.	1
Radium	1
captivated	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
boon	1
to	1
medicine,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
a	1
most	1
puzzling	1
and	1
most	1
attractive	1
phenomenon.	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
some	1
great	1
secret	1
of	1
nature	1
was	1
dimly	1
unveiled	1
in	1
its	1
wonderful	1
manifestations,	1
and	1
there	1
now	1
concentrated	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
gifted	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men--conspicuous	1
amongst	1
them	1
Sir	1
J.	1
J.	1
Thomson,	1
Sir	1
Ernest	1
Rutherford,	1
Sir	1
W.	1
Ramsay,	1
and	1
Professor	1
Soddy--as	1
any	1
age	1
could	1
boast,	1
with	1
an	1
apparatus	1
of	1
research	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
age	1
as	1
the	1
_Aquitania_	1
is	1
beyond	1
a	1
Roman	1
galley.	1
Within	1
five	1
years	1
the	1
secret	1
was	1
fairly	1
mastered.	1
Not	1
only	1
were	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
matter	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
common	1
basis,	1
but	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
were	1
brought	1
into	1
a	1
unity	1
and	1
understood	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
understood	1
before.	1

§	1

The	1
Discovery	1
of	1
the	1
Electron	1
Physicists	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
long	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
radiation	1
from	1
radium	1
was	1
very	1
like	1
the	1
radiation	1
in	1
a	1
"Crookes	1
tube."	1
It	1
was	1
quickly	1
recognised,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
tube	1
and	1
in	1
radium	1
(and	1
other	1
metals)	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter	1
were	1
somehow	1
breaking	1
down.	1
However,	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
was	1
to	1
recognise	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
distinct	1
and	1
different	1
rays	1
that	1
were	1
given	1
off	1
by	1
such	1
metals	1
as	1
radium	1
and	1
uranium.	1
Sir	1
Ernest	1
Rutherford	1
christened	1
them,	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
three	1
letters	1
of	1
the	1
Greek	1
alphabet,	1
the	1
Alpha,	1
the	1
Beta,	1
and	1
Gamma	1
rays.	1
We	1
are	1
concerned	1
chiefly	1
with	1
the	1
second	1
group	1
and	1
purpose	1
here	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
that	1
group	1
only.[3]	1
[3]	1
The	1
"Alpha	1
rays"	1
were	1
presently	1
recognised	1
as	1
atoms	1
of	1
helium	1
gas,	1
shot	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
12,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
The	1
"Gamma	1
rays"	1
are	1
_waves_,	1
like	1
the	1
X-rays,	1
not	1
material	1
particles.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
type	1
of	1
X-rays.	1
They	1
possess	1
the	1
remarkable	1
power	1
of	1
penetrating	1
opaque	1
substances;	1
they	1
will	1
pass	1
through	1
a	1
foot	1
of	1
solid	1
iron,	1
for	1
example.	1
The	1
"Beta	1
rays,"	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
first	1
called,	1
have	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
discoveries	1
that	1
science	1
ever	1
made.	1
They	1
proved	1
what	1
Crookes	1
had	1
surmised	1
about	1
the	1
radiations	1
he	1
discovered	1
in	1
his	1
vacuum	1
tube.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
_not_	1
a	1
fourth	1
state	1
of	1
matter	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
but	1
a	1
new	1
_property_	1
of	1
matter,	1
a	1
property	1
common	1
to	1
all	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter.	1
The	1
Beta	1
rays	1
were	1
later	1
christened	1
Electrons.	1
They	1
are	1
particles	1
of	1
disembodied	1
electricity,	1
here	1
spontaneously	1
liberated	1
from	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter:	1
only	1
when	1
the	1
electron	1
was	1
isolated	1
from	1
the	1
atom	1
was	1
it	1
recognised	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
as	1
a	1
separate	1
entity.	1
Electrons,	1
therefore,	1
are	1
a	1
constituent	1
of	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
discovered	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
atom	1
by	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
agencies.	1
Electrons	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
everywhere,	1
forming	1
part	1
of	1
every	1
atom.	1
"An	1
electron,"	1
Sir	1
William	1
Bragg	1
says,	1
"can	1
only	1
maintain	1
a	1
separate	1
existence	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
travelling	1
at	1
an	1
immense	1
rate,	1
from	1
one	1
three-hundredth	1
of	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
light	1
upwards,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
at	1
least	1
600	1
_miles	1
a	1
second,	1
or	1
thereabouts_.	1
Otherwise	1
the	1
electron	1
sticks	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
atom	1
it	1
meets."	1
These	1
amazing	1
particles	1
may	1
travel	1
with	1
the	1
enormous	1
velocity	1
of	1
from	1
10,000	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
100,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
It	1
was	1
first	1
learned	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
an	1
electrical	1
nature,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
bent	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
normal	1
path	1
if	1
a	1
magnet	1
is	1
brought	1
near	1
them.	1
And	1
this	1
fact	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
further	1
discovery:	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sensational	1
estimates	1
which	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
believe	1
to	1
be	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
abstruse	1
speculations.	1
The	1
physicist	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
chemical	1
screen	1
for	1
the	1
"Beta	1
rays"	1
to	1
hit,	1
and	1
he	1
so	1
arranged	1
his	1
tube	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
narrow	1
sheaf	1
of	1
the	1
rays	1
poured	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
screen.	1
He	1
then	1
drew	1
this	1
sheaf	1
of	1
rays	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
course	1
with	1
a	1
magnet,	1
and	1
he	1
accurately	1
measured	1
the	1
shift	1
of	1
the	1
luminous	1
spot	1
on	1
the	1
screen	1
where	1
the	1
rays	1
impinged	1
on	1
it.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
the	1
exact	1
intensity	1
of	1
his	1
magnetic	1
field--which	1
he	1
can	1
control	1
as	1
he	1
likes--and	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
deviation	1
it	1
causes,	1
and	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
particles,	1
he	1
can	1
tell	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
moving	1
particles	1
which	1
he	1
thus	1
diverts.	1
These	1
particles	1
were	1
being	1
hurled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
radium,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
negative	1
pole	1
in	1
a	1
vacuum	1
tube,	1
at	1
a	1
speed	1
which,	1
in	1
good	1
conditions,	1
reached	1
nearly	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
light,	1
i.e.	1
nearly	1
186,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
Their	1
speed	1
has,	1
of	1
course,	1
been	1
confirmed	1
by	1
numbers	1
of	1
experiments;	1
and	1
another	1
series	1
of	1
experiments	1
enabled	1
physicists	1
to	1
determine	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
particles.	1
Only	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
need	1
be	1
described,	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
reader	1
an	1
idea	1
how	1
men	1
of	1
science	1
arrived	1
at	1
their	1
more	1
startling	1
results.	1
Fog,	1
as	1
most	1
people	1
know,	1
is	1
thick	1
in	1
our	1
great	1
cities	1
because	1
the	1
water-vapour	1
gathers	1
on	1
the	1
particles	1
of	1
dust	1
and	1
smoke	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
atmosphere.	1
This	1
fact	1
was	1
used	1
as	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
some	1
beautiful	1
experiments.	1
Artificial	1
fogs	1
were	1
created	1
in	1
little	1
glass	1
tubes,	1
by	1
introducing	1
dust,	1
in	1
various	1
proportions,	1
for	1
supersaturated	1
vapour	1
to	1
gather	1
on.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
cause	1
tiny	1
drops	1
of	1
rain,	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
dust	1
at	1
its	1
core,	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
a	1
silver	1
mirror	1
and	1
be	1
counted.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
counting	1
the	1
quite	1
invisible	1
particles	1
of	1
dust	1
in	1
the	1
tube;	1
and	1
the	1
method	1
was	1
now	1
successfully	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
rays.	1
Yet	1
another	1
method	1
was	1
to	1
direct	1
a	1
slender	1
stream	1
of	1
the	1
particles	1
upon	1
a	1
chemical	1
screen.	1
The	1
screen	1
glowed	1
under	1
the	1
cannonade	1
of	1
particles,	1
and	1
a	1
powerful	1
lens	1
resolved	1
the	1
glow	1
into	1
distinct	1
sparks,	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
counted.	1
In	1
short,	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
and	1
beautiful	1
experiments,	1
checked	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
laboratories	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
settled	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
these	1
so-called	1
rays.	1
They	1
were	1
streams	1
of	1
particles	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
smallest	1
known	1
atom.	1
The	1
mass	1
of	1
each	1
particle	1
is,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
latest	1
and	1
finest	1
measurements	1
1/1845	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
hydrogen.	1
The	1
physicist	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
any	1
character	1
except	1
electricity	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
"electrons"	1
has	1
been	1
generally	1
adopted.	1
The	1
Key	1
to	1
many	1
Mysteries	1
The	1
Electron	1
is	1
an	1
atom,	1
of	1
disembodied	1
electricity;	1
it	1
occupies	1
an	1
exceedingly	1
small	1
volume,	1
and	1
its	1
"mass"	1
is	1
entirely	1
electrical.	1
These	1
electrons	1
are	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
half	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
matter.	1
Electrons	1
in	1
rapid	1
motion,	1
as	1
we	1
shall	1
see,	1
explain	1
what	1
we	1
mean	1
by	1
an	1
"electric	1
current,"	1
not	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
regarded	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
mysterious	1
manifestations	1
in	1
nature.	1
"What	1
a	1
wonder,	1
then,	1
have	1
we	1
here!"	1
says	1
Professor	1
R.	1
K.	1
Duncan.	1
"An	1
innocent-looking	1

special	1

utterly	1
beyond	1
even	1
the	1
fanciful	1
imaginings	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
past	1

for	1
nowhere	1
do	1
we	1

the	1
hint	1
of	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
now	1

This	1

the	1

Furthermore,	1
they	1

THE	1
ELECTRON	1
THEORY,	1
OR	1
THE	1
NEW	1
VIEW	1
OF	1
MATTER	1
The	1
Structure	1
of	1
the	1
Atom	1
There	1
is	1
general	1
agreement	1
amongst	1
all	1
chemists,	1
physicists,	1
and	1
mathematicians	1
upon	1
the	1
conclusions	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
so	1
far	1
given.	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter	1
are	1
constantly--either	1
spontaneously	1
or	1
under	1
stimulation--giving	1
off	1
electrons,	1
or	1
breaking	1
up	1
into	1
electrons;	1
and	1
they	1
therefore	1
contain	1
electrons.	1
Thus	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
complete	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
independent	1
existence	1
of	1
atoms	1
and	1
also	1
of	1
electrons.	1
When,	1
however,	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
tries	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
_how_	1
electrons	1
compose	1
atoms,	1
he	1
passes	1
from	1
facts	1
to	1
speculation,	1
and	1
very	1
difficult	1
speculation.	1
Take	1
the	1
letter	1
"o"	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
printed	1
on	1
this	1
page.	1
In	1
a	1
little	1
bubble	1
of	1
hydrogen	1
gas	1
no	1
larger	1
than	1
that	1
letter	1
there	1
are	1
_trillions_	1
of	1
atoms;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
packed	1
together,	1
but	1
are	1
circulating	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
dancers	1
in	1
a	1
ball-room.	1
We	1
are	1
asking	1
the	1
physicist	1
to	1
take	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
minute	1
atoms	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
how	1
the	1
still	1
smaller	1
electrons	1
are	1
arranged	1
in	1
it.	1
Naturally	1
he	1
can	1
only	1
make	1
mental	1
pictures,	1
guesses	1
or	1
hypotheses,	1
which	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
fit	1
to	1
the	1
facts,	1
and	1
discards	1
when	1
they	1
will	1
_not_	1
fit.	1
At	1
present,	1
after	1
nearly	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
critical	1
discussion,	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
chief	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
atom.	1
At	1
first	1
Sir	1
J.	1
J.	1
Thomson	1
imagined	1
the	1
electrons	1
circulating	1
in	1
shells	1
(like	1
the	1
layers	1
of	1
an	1
onion)	1
round	1
the	1
nucleus	1
of	1
the	1
atom.	1
This	1
did	1
not	1
suit,	1
and	1
Sir	1
E.	1
Rutherford	1
and	1
others	1
worked	1
out	1
a	1
theory	1
that	1
the	1
electrons	1
circulated	1
round	1
a	1
nucleus	1
rather	1
like	1
the	1
planets	1
of	1
our	1
solar	1
system	1
revolving	1
round	1
the	1
central	1
sun.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
nucleus,	1
then,	1
round	1
which	1
the	1
electrons	1
revolve?	1
The	1
electron,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
is	1
a	1
disembodied	1
atom	1
of	1
electricity;	1
we	1
should	1
say,	1
of	1
"negative"	1
electricity.	1
Let	1
us	1
picture	1
these	1
electrons	1
all	1
moving	1
round	1
in	1
orbits	1
with	1
great	1
velocity.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
suggested	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
nucleus	1
of	1
"positive"	1
electricity	1
attracting	1
or	1
pulling	1
the	1
revolving	1
electrons	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
forming	1
an	1
equilibrium,	1
otherwise	1
the	1
electrons	1
would	1
fly	1
off	1
in	1
all	1
directions.	1
This	1
nucleus	1
has	1
been	1
recently	1
named	1
the	1
proton.	1
We	1
have	1
thus	1
two	1
electricities	1
in	1
the	1
atom:	1
the	1
positive	1
=	1
the	1
nucleus;	1
the	1
negative	1
=	1
the	1
electron.	1
Of	1
recent	1
years	1
Dr.	1
Langmuir	1
has	1
put	1
out	1
a	1
theory	1
that	1
the	1
electrons	1
do	1
not	1
_revolve	1
round_	1
the	1
nucleus,	1
but	1
remain	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
violent	1
agitation	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
at	1
fixed	1
distances	1
from	1
the	1
nucleus.	1

But	1
we	1
will	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
here	1
to	1
the	1
facts,	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
contending	1
theories	1
to	1
scientific	1
men.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
pretty	1
generally	1
accepted	1
that	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
matter	1
consists	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
electrons,	1
or	1
charges	1
of	1
negative	1
electricity,	1
held	1
together	1
by	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
positive	1
electricity.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
disputed	1
that	1
these	1
electrons	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
violent	1
motion	1
or	1
strain,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
a	1
vast	1
energy	1
is	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter.	1
To	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
return	1
later.	1
Here,	1
rather,	1
we	1
will	1
notice	1
another	1
remarkable	1
discovery	1
which	1
helps	1
us	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
matter.	1
A	1
brilliant	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
who	1
was	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
war,	1
Mr.	1
Moseley,	1
some	1
years	1
ago	1
showed	1
that,	1
when	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
different	1
substances	1
are	1
arranged	1
in	1
order	1
of	1
their	1
weight,	1
_they	1
are	1
also	1
arranged	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
increasing	1
complexity	1
of	1
structure_.	1
That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
heavier	1
the	1
atom,	1
the	1
more	1
electrons	1
it	1
contains.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
gradual	1
building	1
up	1
of	1
atoms	1
containing	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
electrons	1
from	1
the	1
lightest	1
atom	1
to	1
the	1
heaviest.	1
Here	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
element	1
after	1
element,	1
from	1
the	1
lightest	1
(hydrogen)	1
to	1
the	1
heaviest	1
(uranium)	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
strangely	1
regular	1
relation	1
between	1
them.	1
If	1
hydrogen	1
were	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
figure	1
one,	1
helium	1
by	1
two,	1
lithium	1
three,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
up	1
to	1
uranium,	1
then	1
uranium	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
figure	1
ninety-two.	1
This	1
makes	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
nature	1
ninety-two	1
elements--we	1
have	1
found	1
eighty-seven--and	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
Mr.	1
Moseley	1
found	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
electrons	1
in	1
the	1
atom	1
of	1
each	1
element;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
number	1
is	1
arranged	1
in	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
atomic	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
elements.	1
§	1

The	1
New	1
View	1
of	1
Matter	1
Up	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
we	1
have	1
reached,	1
then,	1
we	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
of	1
Matter	1
is.	1
Every	1
atom	1
of	1
matter,	1
of	1
whatever	1
kind	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
universe,	1
is	1
built	1
up	1
of	1
electrons	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
a	1
nucleus.	1
From	1
the	1
smallest	1
atom	1
of	1
all--the	1
atom	1
of	1
hydrogen--which	1
consists	1
of	1
one	1
electron,	1
rotating	1
round	1
a	1
positively	1
charged	1
nucleus,	1
to	1
a	1
heavy	1
complicated	1
atom,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
atom	1
of	1
gold,	1
constituted	1
of	1
many	1
electrons	1
and	1
a	1
complex	1
nucleus,	1
_we	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
positive	1
and	1
negative	1
units	1
of	1
electricity_.	1
The	1
electron	1
and	1
its	1
nucleus	1
are	1
particles	1
of	1
electricity.	1
All	1
Matter,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
manifestation	1
of	1
electricity.	1
The	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
combine	1
and	1
form	1
molecules.	1
Atoms	1
and	1
molecules	1
are	1
the	1
bricks	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
nature	1
has	1
built	1
up	1
everything;	1
ourselves,	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
stars,	1
the	1
whole	1
universe.	1
But	1
more	1
than	1
bricks	1
are	1
required	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
house.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
fundamental	1
existences,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
various	1
forms	1
of	1
energy,	1
which	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
several	1
complex	1
problems.	1
And	1
we	1
have	1
also	1
to	1
remember,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
eighty	1
distinct	1
elements,	1
each	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
definite	1
type	1
of	1
atom.	1
We	1
shall	1
deal	1
with	1
energy	1
later.	1
Meanwhile	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
that,	1
although	1
we	1
have	1
discovered	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
the	1
electron	1
and	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
matter,	1
and	1
that	1
while	1
the	1
physicists	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
day	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
explaining	1
positive	1
and	1
negative	1
electricity,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
them	1
both	1
is	1
unknown.	1
There	1
exists	1
the	1
theory	1
that	1
the	1
particles	1
of	1
positive	1
and	1
negative	1
electricity,	1
which	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter,	1
are	1
points	1
or	1
centres	1
of	1
disturbances	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
in	1
a	1
universal	1
ether,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
various	1
forms	1
of	1
energy	1
are,	1
in	1
some	1
fundamental	1
way,	1
aspects	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
primary	1
entity	1
which	1
constitutes	1
matter	1
itself.	1
But	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
radio-activity	1
has	1
raised	1
many	1
other	1
interesting	1
questions,	1
besides	1
that	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
dealt	1
with.	1
In	1
radio-active	1
elements,	1
such	1
as	1
uranium	1
for	1
example,	1
the	1
element	1
is	1
breaking	1
down;	1
in	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
radio-activity	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
spontaneous	1
change	1
of	1
elements.	1
What	1
is	1
really	1
taking	1
place	1
is	1
a	1
transmutation	1
of	1
one	1
element	1
into	1
another,	1
from	1
a	1
heavier	1
to	1
a	1
lighter.	1
The	1
element	1
uranium	1
spontaneously	1
becomes	1
radium,	1
and	1
radium	1
passes	1
through	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
other	1
stages	1
until	1
it,	1
in	1
turn,	1
becomes	1
lead.	1
Each	1
descending	1
element	1
is	1
of	1
lighter	1
atomic	1
weight	1
than	1
its	1
predecessor.	1
The	1
changing	1
process,	1
of	1
course,	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
slow	1
one.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
all	1
matter	1
is	1
radio-active,	1
or	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
so.	1
This	1
raises	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
all	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
may	1
not	1
undergo	1
disintegration.	1
There	1
is,	1
however,	1
another	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
which	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radio-activity	1
has	1
brought	1
to	1
light,	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
effected	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
our	1
views.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
radio-active	1
substances	1
the	1
elements	1
are	1
breaking	1
down.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
process	1
of	1
building	1
up	1
at	1
work?	1
If	1
the	1
more	1
complicated	1
atoms	1
are	1
breaking	1
down	1
into	1
simpler	1
forms,	1
may	1
there	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
converse	1
process--a	1
building	1
up	1
from	1
simpler	1
elements	1
to	1
more	1
complicated	1
elements?	1
It	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
case	1
that	1
both	1
processes	1
are	1
at	1
work.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
eighty-odd	1
chemical	1
elements	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
to-day:	1
are	1
they	1
all	1
the	1
outcome	1
of	1
an	1
inorganic	1
evolution,	1
element	1
giving	1
rise	1
to	1
element,	1
going	1
back	1
and	1
back	1
to	1
some	1
primeval	1
stuff	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
originally	1
derived	1
infinitely	1
long	1
ago?	1
Is	1
there	1
an	1
evolution	1
in	1
the	1
inorganic	1
world	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
going	1
on,	1
parallel	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
living	1
things;	1
or	1
is	1
organic	1
evolution	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
inorganic	1
evolution?	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
evidence	1
there	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
inorganic	1
evolution	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
stars.	1
We	1
cannot	1
go	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
here,	1
nor	1
has	1
the	1
time	1
come	1
for	1
any	1
direct	1
statement	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
findings	1
of	1
modern	1
investigation.	1
Taking	1
it	1
altogether	1
the	1
evidence	1
is	1
steadily	1
accumulating,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
authorities	1
who	1
maintain	1
that	1
already	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
inorganic	1
evolution	1
is	1
convincing	1
enough.	1
The	1
heavier	1
atoms	1
would	1
appear	1
to	1
behave	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
evolved	1
from	1
the	1
lighter.	1
The	1
more	1
complex	1
forms,	1
it	1
is	1
supposed,	1
have	1
_evolved_	1
from	1
the	1
simpler	1
forms.	1
Moseley's	1
discovery,	1
to	1
which	1
reference	1
has	1
been	1
made,	1
points	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
elements	1
are	1
built	1
up	1
one	1
from	1
another.	1
§	1
8	1
Other	1
New	1
Views	1
We	1
may	1
here	1
refer	1
to	1
another	1
new	1
conception	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
radio-activity	1
has	1
given	1
rise.	1
Lord	1
Kelvin,	1
who	1
estimated	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
at	1
twenty	1
million	1
years,	1
reached	1
this	1
estimate	1
by	1
considering	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
a	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
gradually	1
cooling	1
down,	1
"losing	1
its	1
primitive	1
heat,	1
like	1
a	1
loaf	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
oven,	1
at	1
a	1
rate	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
calculated,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
heat	1
radiated	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
contraction."	1
Uranium	1
and	1
radio-activity	1
were	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
Kelvin,	1
and	1
their	1
discovery	1
has	1
upset	1
both	1
his	1
arguments.	1
Radio-active	1
substances,	1
which	1
are	1
perpetually	1
giving	1
out	1
heat,	1
introduce	1
an	1
entirely	1
new	1
factor.	1
We	1
cannot	1
now	1
assume	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
necessarily	1
cooling	1
down;	1
it	1
may	1
even,	1
for	1
all	1
we	1
know,	1
be	1
getting	1
hotter.	1
At	1
the	1
1921	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Association,	1
Professor	1
Rayleigh	1
stated	1
that	1
further	1
knowledge	1
had	1
extended	1
the	1
probable	1
period	1
during	1
which	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
life	1
on	1
this	1
globe	1
to	1
about	1
one	1
thousand	1
million	1
years,	1
and	1
the	1
total	1
age	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
some	1
small	1
multiple	1
of	1
that.	1
The	1
earth,	1
he	1
considers,	1
is	1
not	1
cooling,	1
but	1
"contains	1
an	1
internal	1
source	1
of	1
heat	1
from	1
the	1
disintegration	1
of	1
uranium	1
in	1
the	1
outer	1
crust."	1
On	1
the	1
whole	1
the	1
estimate	1
obtained	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
agreement	1
with	1
the	1
geological	1
estimates.	1
The	1
question,	1
of	1
course,	1
cannot,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
our	1
knowledge,	1
be	1
settled	1
within	1
fixed	1
limits	1
that	1
meet	1
with	1
general	1
agreement.	1

As	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
fundamental	1
existences	1
which	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
more	1
complex	1
problems.	1
The	1
three	1
great	1
fundamental	1
entities	1
in	1
the	1
physical	1
universe	1
are	1
matter,	1
ether,	1
and	1
energy;	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
know,	1
outside	1
these	1
there	1
is	1
nothing.	1
We	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
matter,	1
there	1
remain	1
ether	1
and	1
energy.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
no	1
particle	1
of	1
matter,	1
however	1
small,	1
may	1
be	1
created	1
or	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
empty	1
space--ether	1
pervades	1
everything--so	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
_rest_.	1
Every	1
particle	1
that	1
goes	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
our	1
solid	1
earth	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
perpetual	1
unremitting	1
vibration;	1
energy	1
"is	1
the	1
universal	1
commodity	1
on	1
which	1
all	1
life	1
depends."	1
Separate	1
and	1
distinct	1
as	1
these	1
three	1
fundamental	1
entities--matter,	1
ether,	1
and	1
energy--may	1
appear,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that,	1
after	1
all,	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
different	1
and	1
mysterious	1
phases	1
of	1
an	1
essential	1
"oneness"	1

§	1
9	1
The	1
Future	1
Let	1
us,	1
in	1
concluding	1
this	1
chapter,	1
give	1
just	1
one	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
this	1
new	1
knowledge	1
may	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
valuable	1
practically	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
wonderful	1
intellectually.	1
We	1
saw	1
that	1
electrons	1
are	1
shot	1
out	1
of	1
atoms	1
at	1
a	1
speed	1
that	1
may	1
approach	1
160,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second.	1
Sir	1
Oliver	1
Lodge	1
has	1
written	1
recently	1
that	1
a	1
seventieth	1
of	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
radium	1
discharges,	1
at	1
a	1
speed	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
rifle	1
bullet,	1
thirty	1
million	1
electrons	1
a	1
second.	1
Professor	1
Le	1
Bon	1
has	1
calculated	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
1,340,000	1
barrels	1
of	1
powder	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
bullet	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
electrons.	1
He	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
smallest	1
French	1
copper	1
coin--smaller	1
than	1
a	1
farthing--contains	1
an	1
energy	1
equal	1
to	1
eighty	1
million	1
horsepower.	1
A	1
few	1
pounds	1
of	1
matter	1
contain	1
more	1
energy	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
extract	1
from	1
millions	1
of	1
tons	1
of	1
coal.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
hydrogen	1
at	1
a	1
temperature	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
produce	1
in	1
an	1
electric	1
furnace	1
the	1
electrons	1
spin	1
round	1
at	1
a	1
rate	1
of	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
trillion	1
revolutions	1
a	1
second!	1
Every	1
man	1
asks	1
at	1
once:	1
"Will	1
science	1
ever	1
tap	1
this	1
energy?"	1
If	1
it	1
does,	1
no	1
more	1
smoke,	1
no	1
mining,	1
no	1
transit,	1
no	1
bulky	1
fuel.	1
The	1
energy	1
of	1
an	1
atom	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
only	1
liberated	1
when	1
an	1
atom	1
passes	1
from	1
one	1
state	1
to	1
another.	1
The	1
stored	1
up	1
energy	1
is	1
fortunately	1
fast	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
electrons	1
being	1
held	1
together	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
described.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
"the	1
earth	1
would	1
explode	1
and	1
become	1
a	1
gaseous	1
nebula"!	1
It	1
is	1
believed	1
that	1
some	1
day	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
release,	1
harness,	1
and	1
utilise	1
atomic	1
energy.	1
"I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion,"	1
says	1
Sir	1
William	1
Bragg,	1
"that	1
atom	1
energy	1
will	1
supply	1
our	1
future	1
need.	1
A	1
thousand	1
years	1
may	1
pass	1
before	1
we	1
can	1
harness	1
the	1
atom,	1
or	1
to-morrow	1
might	1
see	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
reins	1
in	1
our	1
hands.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
Physics--research	1
and	1
'accidental'	1
discovery	1
go	1
hand	1
in	1
hand."	1
Half	1
a	1
brick	1
contains	1
as	1
much	1
energy	1
as	1
a	1
small	1
coal-field.	1
The	1
difficulties	1
are	1
tremendous,	1
but,	1
as	1
Sir	1
Oliver	1
Lodge	1
reminds	1
us,	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
scepticism	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
about	1
the	1
utilisation	1
of	1
steam	1
or	1
electricity.	1
"Is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
supposed,"	1
he	1
asks,	1
"that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
fresh	1
invention,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
discoveries	1
have	1
been	1
made?"	1
More	1
than	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
science	1
encourages	1
us	1
to	1
hope.	1
Here	1
are	1
some	1
remarkable	1
words	1
written	1
by	1
Professor	1
Soddy,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
authorities	1
on	1
radio-active	1
matter,	1
in	1
our	1
chief	1
scientific	1
weekly	1
(_Nature_,	1
November	1
6,	1
1919):	1
The	1
prospects	1
of	1
the	1
successful	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
artificial	1
transmutation	1
brighten	1
almost	1
daily.	1
The	1
ancients	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
inkling	1
that	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
transmutation	1
would	1
confer	1
upon	1
men	1
powers	1
hitherto	1
the	1
prerogative	1
of	1
the	1
gods.	1
But	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
definitely	1
that	1
the	1
material	1
aspect	1
of	1
transmutation	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
small	1
importance	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
control	1
over	1
the	1
inexhaustible	1
stores	1
of	1
internal	1
atomic	1
energy	1
to	1
which	1
its	1
successful	1
accomplishment	1
would	1
inevitably	1
lead.	1
It	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
problem,	1
no	1
longer	1
redolent	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
associations	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
alchemy,	1
but	1
one	1
big	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
veritable	1
physical	1
renaissance	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
If	1
that	1
"promise"	1
is	1
ever	1
realised,	1
the	1
economic	1
and	1
social	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
be	1
transformed.	1
Before	1
passing	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
ether,	1
light,	1
and	1
energy,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
what	1
new	1
light	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
electron	1
has	1
thrown	1
on	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
manipulation	1
of	1
electricity.	1
WHAT	1
IS	1
ELECTRICITY?	1
The	1
Nature	1
of	1
Electricity	1
There	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
manifestation	1
in	1
nature,	1
and	1
so	1
late	1
as	1
twenty	1
years	1
ago	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
mysterious	1
manifestations	1
of	1
all,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
great	1
measure	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
discoveries.	1
Already,	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
this	1
century,	1
we	1
spoke	1
of	1
our	1
"age	1
of	1
electricity,"	1
yet	1
there	1
were	1
few	1
things	1
in	1
nature	1
about	1
which	1
we	1
knew	1
less.	1
The	1
"electric	1
current"	1
rang	1
our	1
bells,	1
drove	1
our	1
trains,	1
lit	1
our	1
rooms,	1
but	1
none	1
knew	1
what	1
the	1
current	1
was.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
vague	1
idea	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fluid	1
that	1
flowed	1
along	1
copper	1
wires	1
as	1
water	1
flows	1
in	1
a	1
pipe.	1
We	1
now	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
_a	1
rapid	1
movement	1
of	1
electrons	1
from	1
atom	1
to	1
atom_	1
in	1
the	1
wire	1
or	1
wherever	1
the	1
current	1
is.	1
Let	1
us	1
try	1
to	1
grasp	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
view	1
of	1
electricity	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
applies	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
varied	1
electrical	1
phenomena	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
about	1
us.	1
As	1
we	1
saw,	1
the	1
nucleus	1
of	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
matter	1
consists	1
of	1
positive	1
electricity	1
which	1
holds	1
together	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
electrons,	1
or	1
charges	1
of	1
negative	1
electricity.[4]	1
This	1
certainly	1
tells	1
us	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
what	1
electricity	1
is,	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
related	1
to	1
matter,	1
but	1
it	1
leaves	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
usual	1
difficulty	1
about	1
fundamental	1
realities.	1
But	1
we	1
now	1
know	1
that	1
electricity,	1
like	1
matter,	1
is	1
atomic	1
in	1
structure;	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
electricity	1
is	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
small	1
units	1
or	1
charges	1
of	1
a	1
definite,	1
constant	1
amount.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
suggested	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
electricity,	1
i.e.	1
positive	1
and	1
negative,	1
are	1
right-handed	1
and	1
left-handed	1
vortices	1
or	1
whirlpools	1
in	1
ether,	1
or	1
rings	1
in	1
ether,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
serious	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
we	1
leave	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
future.	1
[4]	1
The	1
words	1
"positive"	1
and	1
"negative"	1
electricity	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
fluid.	1
A	1
body	1
overcharged	1
with	1
the	1
fluid	1
was	1
called	1
positive;	1
an	1
undercharged	1
body	1
was	1
called	1
negative.	1
A	1
positively-electrified	1
body	1
is	1
now	1
one	1
whose	1
atoms	1
have	1
lost	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
outlying	1
electrons,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
positive	1
charge	1
of	1
electricity	1
predominates.	1
The	1
negatively-electrified	1
body	1
is	1
one	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
normal	1
number	1
of	1
electrons.	1

What	1
an	1
Electric	1
Current	1
is	1
The	1
discovery	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
electricity	1
has,	1
however,	1
enabled	1
us	1
to	1
understand	1
very	1
fairly	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
electrical	1
phenomena.	1
The	1
outlying	1
electrons,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
may	1
pass	1
from	1
atom	1
to	1
atom,	1
and	1
this,	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale,	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
electric	1
current.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
we	1
believe	1
an	1
electric	1
current	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
electrons.	1
Let	1
us	1
take,	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
a	1
simple	1
electrical	1
"cell,"	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
feeble	1
current	1
is	1
generated:	1
such	1
a	1
cell	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
every	1
house	1
to	1
serve	1
its	1
electric	1
bells.	1
In	1
the	1
original	1
form	1
this	1
simple	1
sort	1
of	1
"battery"	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
zinc	1
and	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
copper	1
immersed	1
in	1
a	1
chemical.	1
Long	1
before	1
anything	1
was	1
known	1
about	1
electrons	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
that,	1
if	1
you	1
put	1
zinc	1
and	1
copper	1
together,	1
you	1
produce	1
a	1
mild	1
current	1
of	1
electricity.	1
We	1
know	1
now	1
what	1
this	1
means.	1
Zinc	1
is	1
a	1
metal	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
particularly	1
disposed	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
outlying	1
electrons.	1
Why,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
these	1
small	1
batteries.	1
Electrons	1
from	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
zinc	1
pass	1
to	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
copper,	1
and	1
their	1
passage	1
is	1
a	1
"current."	1
Each	1
atom	1
gives	1
up	1
an	1
electron	1
to	1
its	1
neighbour.	1
It	1
was	1
further	1
found	1
long	1
ago	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
zinc	1
and	1
copper	1
were	1
immersed	1
in	1
certain	1
chemicals,	1
which	1
slowly	1
dissolve	1
the	1
zinc,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
metals	1
were	1
connected	1
by	1
a	1
copper	1
wire,	1
the	1
current	1
was	1
stronger.	1
In	1
modern	1
language,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
brisker	1
flow	1
of	1
electrons.	1
The	1
reason	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
zinc	1
which	1
are	1
stolen	1
by	1
the	1
chemical	1
leave	1
their	1
detachable	1
electrons	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
zinc	1
has	1
therefore	1
more	1
electrons	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
copper.	1

DISINTEGRATION	1
OF	1
ATOMS	1
An	1
atom	1
of	1
Uranium,	1
by	1
ejecting	1
an	1
Alpha	1
particle,	1
becomes	1
Uranium	1
X.	1
This	1
substance,	1
by	1
ejecting	1
Beta	1
and	1
Gamma	1
rays,	1
becomes	1
Radium.	1
Radium	1
passes	1
through	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
further	1
changes,	1
as	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
diagram,	1
and	1
finally	1
becomes	1
lead.	1
Some	1
radio-active	1
substances	1
disintegrate	1
much	1
faster	1
than	1
others.	1
Thus	1
Uranium	1
changes	1
very	1
slowly,	1
taking	1
5,000,000,000	1
years	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
same	1
stage	1
of	1
disintegration	1
that	1
Radium	1
A	1
reaches	1
in	1
3	1
minutes.	1
As	1
the	1
disintegration	1
proceeds,	1
the	1
substances	1
become	1
of	1
lighter	1
and	1
lighter	1
atomic	1
weights.	1
Thus	1
Uranium	1
has	1
an	1
atomic	1
weight	1
of	1
238,	1
whereas	1
lead	1
has	1
an	1
atomic	1
weight	1
of	1
only	1
206.	1

The	1

as	1
a	1
feather,	1
as	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
above	1
illustration.]	1
Such	1
cells	1
are	1
now	1
made	1
of	1
zinc	1
and	1
carbon,	1
immersed	1
in	1
sal-ammoniac,	1
but	1
the	1
principle	1
is	1
the	1
same.	1
The	1
flow	1
of	1
electricity	1
is	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
electrons;	1
though	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
repeat	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
flow	1
in	1
a	1
body,	1
as	1
molecules	1
of	1
water	1
do.	1
You	1
may	1
have	1
seen	1
boys	1
place	1
a	1
row	1
of	1
bricks,	1
each	1
standing	1
on	1
one	1
end,	1
in	1
such	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
first,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
pushed,	1
will	1
knock	1
over	1
the	1
second,	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
third,	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
_movement_	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
line,	1
but	1
each	1
brick	1
moves	1
only	1
a	1
short	1
distance.	1
So	1
an	1
electron	1
merely	1
passes	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
atom,	1
which	1
sends	1
on	1
an	1
electron	1
to	1
a	1
third	1
atom,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
In	1
this	1
case,	1
however,	1
the	1
movement	1
from	1
atom	1
to	1
atom	1
is	1
so	1
rapid	1
that	1
the	1
ripple	1
of	1
movement,	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
it	1
so,	1
may	1
pass	1
along	1
at	1
an	1
enormous	1
speed.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
swiftly	1
electrons	1
travel.	1
But	1
how	1
is	1
this	1
turned	1
into	1
power	1
enough	1
even	1
to	1
ring	1
a	1
bell?	1
The	1
actual	1
mechanical	1
apparatus	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
electron	1
current	1
is	1
turned	1
into	1
sound,	1
or	1
heat,	1
or	1
light	1
will	1
be	1
described	1
in	1
a	1
technical	1
section	1
later	1
in	1
this	1
work.	1
We	1
are	1
concerned	1
here	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
principle,	1
which	1
is	1
clear.	1
While	1
zinc	1
is	1
very	1
apt	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
electrons,	1
copper	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
obliging	1
in	1
facilitating	1
their	1
passage	1
onward.	1
Electrons	1
will	1
travel	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
most	1
metals,	1
but	1
copper	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
"conductors."	1
So	1
we	1
lengthen	1
the	1
copper	1
wire	1
between	1
the	1
zinc	1
and	1
the	1
carbon	1
until	1
it	1
goes	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
and	1
the	1
bell,	1
which	1
are	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
circuit.	1
When	1
you	1
press	1
the	1
button	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
two	1
wires	1
are	1
brought	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
electrons	1
rushes	1
round	1
the	1
circuit;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
bell	1
its	1
energy	1
is	1
diverted	1
into	1
the	1
mechanical	1
apparatus	1
which	1
rings	1
the	1
bell.	1
Copper	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
conductor--six	1
times	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
iron--and	1
is	1
therefore	1
so	1
common	1
in	1
electrical	1
industries.	1
Some	1
other	1
substances	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
stubborn	1
as	1
copper	1
is	1
yielding,	1
and	1
we	1
call	1
them	1
"insulators,"	1
because	1
they	1
resist	1
the	1
current	1
instead	1
of	1
letting	1
it	1
flow.	1
Their	1
atoms	1
do	1
not	1
easily	1
part	1
with	1
electrons.	1
Glass,	1
vulcanite,	1
and	1
porcelain	1
are	1
very	1
good	1
insulators	1
for	1
this	1
reason.	1
What	1
the	1
Dynamo	1
does	1
But	1
even	1
several	1
cells	1
together	1
do	1
not	1
produce	1
the	1
currents	1
needed	1
in	1
modern	1
industry,	1
and	1
the	1
flow	1
is	1
produced	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner.	1
As	1
the	1
invisible	1
electrons	1
pass	1
along	1
a	1
wire	1
they	1
produce	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
magnetic	1
field	1
around	1
the	1
wire,	1
they	1
produce	1
a	1
disturbance	1
in	1
the	1
surrounding	1
ether.	1
To	1
be	1
exact,	1
it	1
is	1
through	1
the	1
ether	1
surrounding	1
the	1
wire	1
that	1
the	1
energy	1
originated	1
by	1
the	1
electrons	1
is	1
transmitted.	1
To	1
set	1
electrons	1
moving	1
on	1
a	1
large	1
scale	1
we	1
use	1
a	1
"dynamo."	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
dynamo	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
transform	1
mechanical	1
energy	1
into	1
electrical	1
energy.	1
The	1
modern	1
dynamo,	1
as	1
Professor	1
Soddy	1
puts	1
it,	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
an	1
electron	1
pump.	1
We	1
cannot	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
subject	1
deeply	1
here,	1
we	1
would	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
large	1
coil	1
of	1
copper	1
wire	1
is	1
caused	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
rapidly	1
between	1
the	1
poles	1
of	1
a	1
powerful	1
magnet.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
essential	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
"dynamo,"	1
which	1
is	1
used	1
for	1
generating	1
strong	1
currents.	1
We	1
shall	1
see	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
how	1
magnetism	1
differs	1
from	1
electricity,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
here	1
only	1
that	1
round	1
the	1
poles	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
magnet	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
intense	1
disturbance	1
which	1
will	1
start	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
electrons	1
in	1
any	1
copper	1
that	1
is	1
introduced	1
into	1
it.	1
On	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
speed	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
coil	1
of	1
wire	1
its	1
atoms	1
enter	1
suddenly	1
this	1
magnetic	1
field,	1
and	1
they	1
give	1
off	1
crowds	1
of	1
electrons	1
in	1
a	1
flash.	1
It	1
is	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
similar	1
disturbance	1
is	1
caused,	1
though	1
the	1
flow	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
_opposite_	1
direction,	1
when	1
the	1
coil	1
of	1
wire	1
leaves	1
the	1
magnetic	1
field.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
coil	1
is	1
revolving	1
very	1
rapidly	1
we	1
get	1
a	1
powerful	1
current	1
of	1
electricity	1
that	1
runs	1
in	1
alternate	1
directions--an	1
"alternating"	1
current.	1
Electricians	1
have	1
apparatus	1
for	1
converting	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
continuous	1
current	1
where	1
this	1
is	1
necessary.	1
A	1
current,	1
therefore,	1
means	1
a	1
steady	1
flow	1
of	1
the	1
electrons	1
from	1
atom	1
to	1
atom.	1
Sometimes,	1
however,	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
electrons	1
rush	1
violently	1
and	1
explosively	1
from	1
one	1
body	1
to	1
another,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
electric	1
spark	1
or	1
the	1
occasional	1
flash	1
from	1
an	1
electric	1
tram	1
or	1
train.	1
The	1
grandest	1
and	1
most	1
spectacular	1
display	1
of	1
this	1
phenomenon	1
is	1
the	1
thunderstorm.	1
As	1
we	1
saw	1
earlier,	1
a	1
portentous	1
furnace	1
like	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
constantly	1
pouring	1
floods	1
of	1
electrons	1
from	1
its	1
atoms	1
into	1
space.	1
The	1
earth	1
intercepts	1
great	1
numbers	1
of	1
these	1
electrons.	1
In	1
the	1
upper	1
regions	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
solar	1
electrons	1
has	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
separating	1
positively-electrified	1
atoms	1
from	1
negatively-electrified	1
ones,	1
and	1
the	1
water-vapour,	1
which	1
is	1
constantly	1
rising	1
from	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
gathers	1
more	1
freely	1
round	1
the	1
positively-electrified	1
atoms,	1
and	1
brings	1
them	1
down,	1
as	1
rain,	1
to	1
the	1
earth.	1
Thus	1
the	1
upper	1
air	1
loses	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
positive	1
electricity,	1
or	1
becomes	1
"negatively	1
electrified."	1
In	1
the	1
thunderstorm	1
we	1
get	1
both	1
kinds	1
of	1
clouds--some	1
with	1
large	1
excesses	1
of	1
electrons,	1
and	1
some	1
deficient	1
in	1
electrons--and	1
the	1
tension	1
grows	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
is	1
relieved	1
by	1
a	1
sudden	1
and	1
violent	1
discharge	1
of	1
electrons	1
from	1
one	1
cloud	1
to	1
another	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
earth--an	1
electric	1
spark	1
on	1
a	1
prodigious	1
scale.	1
§	1

Magnetism	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
an	1
electric	1
current	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
flow	1
of	1
electrons.	1
Now	1
an	1
electric	1
current	1
exhibits	1
a	1
magnetic	1
effect.	1
The	1
surrounding	1
space	1
is	1
endowed	1
with	1
energy	1
which	1
we	1
call	1
electro-magnetic	1
energy.	1
A	1
piece	1
of	1
magnetised	1
iron	1
attracting	1
other	1
pieces	1
of	1
iron	1
to	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
popular	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
magnet.	1
If	1
we	1
arrange	1
a	1
wire	1
to	1
pass	1
vertically	1
through	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cardboard	1
and	1
then	1
sprinkle	1
iron	1
filings	1
on	1
the	1
cardboard	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
that,	1
on	1
passing	1
an	1
electric	1
current	1
through	1
the	1
wire,	1
the	1
iron	1
filings	1
arrange	1
themselves	1
in	1
circles	1
round	1
it.	1
The	1
magnetic	1
force,	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
electric	1
current,	1
seems	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
circles	1
round	1
the	1
wire,	1
an	1
ether	1
disturbance	1
being	1
set	1
up.	1
Even	1
a	1
single	1
electron,	1
when	1
in	1
movement,	1
creates	1
a	1
magnetic	1
"field,"	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
round	1
its	1
path.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
movement	1
of	1
electrons	1
without	1
this	1
attendant	1
field	1
of	1
energy,	1
and	1
their	1
motion	1
is	1
not	1
stopped	1
until	1
that	1
field	1
of	1
energy	1
disappears	1
from	1
the	1
ether.	1
The	1
modern	1
theory	1
of	1
magnetism	1
supposes	1
that	1
all	1
magnetism	1
is	1
produced	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
All	1
magnetism	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
small	1
whirling	1
motions	1
of	1
the	1
electrons	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
ultimate	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter.	1
We	1
cannot	1
here	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
theory	1
nor	1
explain	1
why,	1
for	1
instance,	1
iron	1
behaves	1
so	1
differently	1
from	1
other	1
substances,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
sufficient	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
here,	1
also,	1
the	1
electron	1
theory	1
provides	1
the	1
key.	1
This	1
theory	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
definitely	1
_proved_,	1
but	1
it	1
furnishes	1
a	1
sufficient	1
theoretical	1
basis	1
for	1
future	1
research.	1
The	1
earth	1
itself	1
is	1
a	1
gigantic	1
magnet,	1
a	1
fact	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
compass	1
possible,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
earth's	1
magnetism	1
is	1
affected	1
by	1
those	1
great	1
outbreaks	1
on	1
the	1
sun	1
called	1
sun-spots.	1
Now	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
recently	1
shown	1
that	1
a	1
sun-spot	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
whirlpool	1
of	1
electrons	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
exerts	1
a	1
strong	1
magnetic	1
action.	1
There	1
is	1
doubtless	1
a	1
connection	1
between	1
these	1
outbreaks	1
of	1
electronic	1
activity	1
and	1
the	1
consequent	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
earth's	1
magnetism.	1
The	1
precise	1
mechanism	1
of	1
the	1
connection,	1
however,	1
is	1
still	1
a	1
matter	1
that	1
is	1
being	1
investigated.	1
ETHER	1
AND	1
WAVES	1
Ether	1
and	1
Waves	1
The	1
whole	1
material	1
universe	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
embedded	1
in	1
a	1
vast	1
medium	1
called	1
the	1
ether.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
ether	1
has	1
been	1
abandoned	1
by	1
some	1
modern	1
physicists,	1
but,	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
it	1
is	1
ultimately	1
dispensed	1
with,	1
the	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
ether	1
has	1
entered	1
so	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
scientific	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
physics	1
cannot	1
be	1
understood	1
unless	1
we	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
properties	1
attributed	1
to	1
the	1
ether.	1
The	1
ether	1
was	1
invented	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
light,	1
and	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
flow	1
of	1
energy	1
across	1
empty	1
space.	1
Light	1
takes	1
time	1
to	1
travel.	1
We	1
see	1
the	1
sun	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
left	1
it	1
8	1
minutes	1
before.	1
It	1
has	1
taken	1
that	1
8	1
minutes	1
for	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
travel	1
that	1
93,000,000	1
miles	1
odd	1
which	1
separates	1
it	1
from	1
our	1
earth.	1
Besides	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
light	1
takes	1
time	1
to	1
travel,	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
light	1
travels	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
waves.	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
sound	1
travels	1
in	1
waves;	1
sound	1
consists	1
of	1
waves	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
or	1
water	1
or	1
wood	1
or	1
whatever	1
medium	1
we	1
hear	1
it	1
through.	1
If	1
an	1
electric	1
bell	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
glass	1
jar	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
be	1
pumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
jar,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bell	1
becomes	1
feebler	1
and	1
feebler	1
until,	1
when	1
enough	1
air	1
has	1
been	1
taken	1
out,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
bell	1
at	1
all.	1
Sound	1
cannot	1
travel	1
in	1
a	1
vacuum.	1
We	1
continue	1
to	1
_see_	1
the	1
bell,	1
however,	1
so	1
that	1
evidently	1
light	1
can	1
travel	1
in	1
a	1
vacuum.	1
The	1
invisible	1
medium	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
light	1
travel	1
is	1
the	1
ether,	1
and	1
this	1
ether	1
permeates	1
all	1
space	1
_and	1
all	1
matter_.	1
Between	1
us	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
stretch	1
vast	1
regions	1
empty	1
of	1
all	1
matter.	1
But	1
we	1
see	1
the	1
stars;	1
their	1
light	1
reaches	1
us,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
take	1
centuries	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
We	1
conceive,	1
then,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
universal	1
ether	1
which	1
conveys	1
that	1
light.	1
All	1
the	1
energy	1
which	1
has	1
reached	1
the	1
earth	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
which,	1
stored	1
for	1
ages	1
in	1
our	1
coal-fields,	1
is	1
now	1
used	1
to	1
propel	1
our	1
trains	1
and	1
steamships,	1
to	1
heat	1
and	1
light	1
our	1
cities,	1
to	1
perform	1
all	1
the	1
multifarious	1
tasks	1
of	1
modern	1
life,	1
was	1
conveyed	1
by	1
the	1
ether.	1
Without	1
that	1
universal	1
carrier	1
of	1
energy	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
stagnant,	1
lifeless	1
world.	1

AN	1
ETHER	1
DISTURBANCE	1
AROUND	1
AN	1
ELECTRON	1
CURRENT	1
In	1
the	1
left-hand	1
photograph	1
an	1
electric	1
current	1
is	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
coil,	1
thus	1
producing	1
a	1
magnetic	1
field	1
and	1
transforming	1
the	1
poker	1
into	1
a	1
magnet.	1
The	1
poker	1
is	1
then	1
able	1
to	1
support	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
scissors.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
electric	1
current	1
is	1
broken	1
off,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
photograph,	1
the	1
ether	1
disturbance	1
ceases.	1
The	1
poker	1
loses	1
its	1
magnetism,	1
and	1
the	1
scissors	1
fall.]	1
We	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
light	1
consists	1
of	1
waves.	1
The	1
ether	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
resembling,	1
in	1
some	1
respects,	1
a	1
jelly.	1
It	1
can	1
transmit	1
vibrations.	1
The	1
waves	1
of	1
light	1
are	1
really	1
excessively	1
small	1
ripples,	1
measuring	1
from	1
crest	1
to	1
crest.	1
The	1
distance	1
from	1
crest	1
to	1
crest	1
of	1
the	1
ripples	1
in	1
a	1
pond	1
is	1
sometimes	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
inch	1
or	1
two.	1
This	1
distance	1
is	1
enormously	1
great	1
compared	1
to	1
the	1
longest	1
of	1
the	1
wave-lengths	1
that	1
constitute	1
light.	1
We	1
say	1
the	1
longest,	1
for	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
light	1
differ	1
in	1
length;	1
the	1
colour	1
depends	1
upon	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
light.	1
Red	1
light	1
has	1
the	1
longest	1
waves	1
and	1
violet	1
the	1
shortest.	1
The	1
longest	1
waves,	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
deep-red	1
light,	1
are	1
seven	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
thousandths	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
length	1
(7/250,000	1
inch).	1
This	1
is	1
nearly	1
twice	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
deep-violet	1
light-waves,	1
which	1
are	1
1/67,000	1
inch.	1
But	1
light-waves,	1
the	1
waves	1
that	1
affect	1
the	1
eye,	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
waves	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
ether.	1
Waves	1
too	1
short	1
to	1
affect	1
the	1
eye	1
can	1
affect	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
discover	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
waves	1
only	1
half	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
deep-violet	1
waves.	1
Still	1
shorter	1
waves	1
can	1
be	1
discovered,	1
until	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
those	1
excessively	1
minute	1
rays,	1
the	1
X-rays.	1
Below	1
the	1
Limits	1
of	1
Visibility	1
But	1
we	1
can	1
extend	1
our	1
investigations	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
direction;	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
ether	1
carries	1
many	1
waves	1
longer	1
than	1
light-waves.	1
Special	1
photographic	1
emulsions	1
can	1
reveal	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
waves	1
five	1
times	1
longer	1
than	1
violet-light	1
waves.	1
Extending	1
below	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
visibility	1
are	1
waves	1
we	1
detect	1
as	1
heat-waves.	1
Radiant	1
heat,	1
like	1
the	1
heat	1
from	1
a	1
fire,	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
wave-motion	1
in	1
the	1
ether,	1
but	1
the	1
waves	1
our	1
senses	1
recognise	1
as	1
heat	1
are	1
longer	1
than	1
light-waves.	1
There	1
are	1
longer	1
waves	1
still,	1
but	1
our	1
senses	1
do	1
not	1
recognise	1
them.	1
But	1
we	1
can	1
detect	1
them	1
by	1
our	1
instruments.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
waves	1
used	1
in	1
wireless	1
telegraphy,	1
and	1
their	1
length	1
may	1
be,	1
in	1
some	1
cases,	1
measured	1
in	1
miles.	1
These	1
waves	1
are	1
the	1
so-called	1
electro-magnetic	1
waves.	1
Light,	1
radiant	1
heat,	1
and	1
electro-magnetic	1
waves	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
nature;	1
they	1
differ	1
only	1
as	1
regards	1
their	1
wave-lengths.	1
LIGHT--VISIBLE	1
AND	1
INVISIBLE	1
If	1
Light,	1
then,	1
consists	1
of	1
waves	1
transmitted	1
through	1
the	1
ether,	1
what	1
gives	1
rise	1
to	1
the	1
waves?	1
Whatever	1
sets	1
up	1
such	1
wonderfully	1
rapid	1
series	1
of	1
waves	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1
vibration.	1
We	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
electron:	1
all	1
atoms	1
of	1
matter,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
are	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
electrons	1
revolving	1
in	1
a	1
regular	1
orbit	1
round	1
a	1
nucleus.	1
These	1
electrons	1
may	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
out-side	1
influences,	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
agitated	1
and	1
their	1
speed	1
or	1
vibration	1
increased.	1
Electrons	1
and	1
Light	1
The	1
particles	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1

cold	1
iron	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1

vibration.	1
No	1
nerves	1
of	1
ours	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
feel	1
and	1
register	1
the	1
waves	1
they	1
emit,	1
but	1
your	1
cold	1
poker	1
is	1
really	1
radiating,	1
or	1
sending	1
out	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
wave-movements,	1
on	1
every	1
side.	1
After	1
what	1
we	1
saw	1
about	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
matter,	1
this	1
will	1
surprise	1
none.	1
Put	1
your	1
poker	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
for	1
a	1
time.	1
The	1
particles	1
of	1
the	1
glowing	1
coal,	1
which	1
are	1
violently	1
agitated,	1
communicate	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
energy	1
to	1
the	1
particles	1
of	1
iron	1
in	1
the	1
poker.	1
They	1
move	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
more	1
rapidly,	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
which	1
they	1
create	1
are	1
now	1
able	1
to	1
affect	1
your	1
nerves	1
and	1
cause	1
a	1
sensation	1
of	1
heat.	1
Put	1
the	1
poker	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
until	1
its	1
temperature	1
rises	1
to	1
500°	1
C.	1
It	1
begins	1
to	1
glow	1
with	1
a	1
dull	1
red.	1
Its	1
particles	1
are	1
now	1
moving	1
very	1
violently,	1
and	1
the	1
waves	1
they	1
send	1
out	1
are	1
so	1
short	1
and	1
rapid	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
picked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
eye--we	1
have	1
_visible_	1
light.	1
They	1
would	1
still	1
not	1
affect	1
a	1
photographic	1
plate.	1
Heat	1
the	1
iron	1
further,	1
and	1
the	1
crowds	1
of	1
electrons	1
now	1
send	1
out	1
waves	1
of	1
various	1
lengths	1
which	1
blend	1
into	1
white	1
light.	1
What	1
is	1
happening	1
is	1
the	1
agitated	1
electrons	1
flying	1
round	1
in	1
their	1
orbits	1
at	1
a	1
speed	1
of	1
trillions	1
of	1
times	1
a	1
second.	1
Make	1
the	1
iron	1
"blue	1
hot,"	1
and	1
it	1
pours	1
out,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
light,	1
the	1
_invisible_	1
waves	1
which	1
alter	1
the	1
film	1
on	1
the	1
photographic	1
plate.	1
And	1
beyond	1
these	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
range	1
of	1
still	1
shorter	1
waves,	1
culminating	1
in	1
the	1
X-rays,	1
which	1
will	1
pass	1
between	1
the	1
atoms	1
of	1
flesh	1
or	1
stone.	1
Nearly	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
years	1
ago	1
it	1
was	1
proved	1
that	1
light	1
travelled	1
at	1
least	1
600,000	1
times	1
faster	1
than	1
sound.	1
Jupiter,	1
as	1
we	1
saw,	1
has	1
moons,	1
which	1
circle	1
round	1
it.	1
They	1
pass	1
behind	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
planet,	1
and	1
reappear	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
noticed	1
that,	1
when	1
Jupiter	1
is	1
at	1
its	1
greatest	1
distance	1
from	1
us,	1
the	1
reappearance	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
from	1
behind	1
it	1
is	1
16	1
minutes	1
and	1
36	1
seconds	1
later	1
than	1
when	1
the	1
planet	1
is	1
nearest	1
to	1
us.	1
Plainly	1
this	1
was	1
because	1
light	1
took	1
so	1
long	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
additional	1
distance.	1
The	1
distance	1
was	1
then	1
imperfectly	1
known,	1
and	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
light	1
was	1
underrated.	1
We	1
now	1
know	1
the	1
distance,	1
and	1
we	1
easily	1
get	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
light.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
seems	1
far	1
more	1
wonderful	1
to	1
discover	1
this	1
within	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
a	1
laboratory,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
as	1
long	1
ago	1
as	1
1850.	1
A	1
cogged	1
wheel	1
is	1
so	1
mounted	1
that	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
passes	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
teeth	1
and	1
is	1
reflected	1
back	1
from	1
a	1
mirror.	1
Now,	1
slight	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
fraction	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
which	1
light	1
takes	1
to	1
travel	1
that	1
distance,	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
to	1
give	1
such	1
speed	1
to	1
the	1
wheel	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
tooth	1
catches	1
the	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
on	1
its	1
return	1
and	1
cuts	1
it	1
off.	1
The	1
speed	1
is	1
increased	1
still	1
further	1
until	1
the	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
returns	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
observer	1
through	1
the	1
notch	1
_next_	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
mirror!	1
The	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
wheel	1
was	1
known,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
thus	1
possible	1
again	1
to	1
gather	1
the	1
velocity	1
of	1
light.	1
If	1
the	1
shortest	1
waves	1
are	1
1/67,000	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
in	1
length,	1
and	1
light	1
travels	1
at	1
186,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second,	1
any	1
person	1
can	1
work	1
out	1
that	1
about	1
800	1
trillion	1
waves	1
enter	1
the	1
eye	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
when	1
we	1
see	1
"violet."	1
Sorting	1
out	1
Light-waves	1
The	1
waves	1
sent	1
out	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
by	1
the	1
energetic	1
electrons	1
become	1
faintly	1
visible	1
to	1
us	1
when	1
they	1
reach	1
about	1
1/35,000	1
of	1
an	1
inch.	1
As	1
they	1
become	1
shorter	1
and	1
more	1
rapid,	1
as	1
the	1
electrons	1
increase	1
their	1
speed,	1
we	1
get,	1
in	1
succession,	1
the	1
colours	1
red,	1
orange,	1
yellow,	1
green,	1
blue,	1
indigo,	1
and	1
violet.	1
Each	1
distinct	1
sensation	1
of	1
colour	1
means	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
different	1
length.	1
When	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
mingled	1
together,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
we	1
get	1
white	1
light.	1
When	1
this	1
white	1
light	1
passes	1
through	1
glass,	1
the	1
speed	1
of	1
the	1
waves	1
is	1
lessened;	1
and,	1
if	1
the	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
falls	1
obliquely	1
on	1
a	1
triangular	1
piece	1
of	1
glass,	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
different	1
lengths	1
part	1
company	1
as	1
they	1
travel	1
through	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
is	1
spread	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
rainbow-colour.	1
The	1
waves	1
are	1
sorted	1
out	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
lengths	1
in	1
the	1
"obstacle	1
race"	1
through	1
the	1
glass.	1
Anyone	1
may	1
see	1
this	1
for	1
himself	1
by	1
holding	1
up	1
a	1
wedge-shaped	1
piece	1
of	1
crystal	1
between	1
the	1
sunlight	1
and	1
the	1
eye;	1
the	1
prism	1
separates	1
the	1
sunlight	1
into	1
its	1
constituent	1
colours,	1
and	1
these	1
various	1
colours	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
quite	1
readily.	1
Or	1
the	1
thing	1
may	1
be	1
realised	1
in	1
another	1
way.	1
If	1
the	1
seven	1
colours	1
are	1
painted	1
on	1
a	1
wheel	1
as	1
shown	1
opposite	1
page	1
280	1
(in	1
the	1
proportion	1
shown),	1
and	1
the	1
wheel	1
rapidly	1
revolved	1
on	1
a	1
pivot,	1
the	1
wheel	1
will	1
appear	1
a	1
dull	1
white,	1
the	1
several	1
colours	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
_omit_	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
colours,	1
then	1
the	1
wheel,	1
when	1
revolved,	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
white,	1
but	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
one	1
colour,	1
corresponding	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
six	1
colours	1
gives.	1
Another	1
experiment	1
will	1
show	1
that	1
some	1
bodies	1
held	1
up	1
between	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
a	1
white	1
light	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
all	1
the	1
rays	1
to	1
pass	1
through,	1
but	1
will	1
intercept	1
some;	1
a	1
body	1
that	1
intercepts	1
all	1
the	1
seven	1
rays	1
except	1
red	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
red,	1
or	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
rays	1
except	1
violet,	1
then	1
violet	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
colour	1
seen.	1

Professor	1

an	1

picture	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
happen	1
when	1
the	1
sun's	1
light	1
and	1
heat	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
The	1
human	1
eye	1
"has	1
adapted	1
itself	1
through	1
the	1
ages	1
to	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1

so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
that	1
wave-length	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
most....	1
Let	1
us	1
indulge	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
these	1
gloomy	1
prognostications,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
consequences	1
to	1
this	1
earth	1
of	1
the	1
cooling	1
of	1
the	1

with	1
the	1
lapse	1

which	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
vogue,	1
but	1
which	1
radio-activity	1
has	1
so	1
rudely	1
shaken.	1
Picture	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
dull	1
red-hot	1
ball,	1
or	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
cooled	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
emit	1
light	1
to	1
us.	1
That	1
does	1
not	1
all	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
inky	1
darkness,	1
and	1
that	1

§	1
12	1
What	1
the	1
Blue	1
"Sky"	1
means	1
We	1
saw	1
in	1
a	1
previous	1
chapter	1
how	1
the	1
spectroscope	1
splits	1
up	1
light-waves	1
into	1
their	1
colours.	1
But	1
nature	1
is	1
constantly	1
splitting	1
the	1
light	1
into	1
its	1
different-lengthed	1
waves,	1
its	1
colours.	1
The	1
rainbow,	1
where	1
dense	1
moisture	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
acts	1
as	1
a	1
spectroscope,	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
familiar	1
example.	1
A	1
piece	1
of	1
mother-of-pearl,	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
film	1
of	1
oil	1
on	1
the	1
street	1
or	1
on	1
water,	1
has	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
fine	1
inequalities	1
in	1
its	1
surface.	1
The	1
atmosphere	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
is	1
sorting	1
out	1
the	1
waves.	1
The	1
blue	1
"sky"	1
overhead	1
means	1
that	1
the	1
fine	1
particles	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
atmosphere	1
catch	1
the	1
shorter	1
waves,	1
the	1
blue	1
waves,	1
and	1
scatter	1
them.	1
We	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
tubeful	1
of	1
blue	1
sky	1
in	1
the	1
laboratory	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
The	1
beautiful	1
pink-flush	1
on	1
the	1
Alps	1
at	1
sunrise,	1
the	1
red	1
glory	1
that	1
lingers	1
in	1
the	1
west	1
at	1
sunset,	1
mean	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays	1
must	1
struggle	1
through	1
denser	1
masses	1
of	1
air	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
low	1
on	1
the	1
horizon,	1
the	1
long	1
red	1
waves	1
are	1
sifted	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
shafts.	1
Then	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
varied	1
face	1
of	1
nature	1
which,	1
by	1
absorbing	1
some	1
waves	1
and	1
reflecting	1
others,	1
weaves	1
its	1
own	1
beautiful	1
robe	1
of	1
colour.	1
Here	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
black	1
patch,	1
which	1
_absorbs_	1
all	1
the	1
light.	1
White	1
surfaces	1
_reflect_	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it.	1
What	1
is	1
reflected	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
vibration	1
of	1
the	1
electrons	1
in	1
the	1
particular	1
kind	1
of	1
matter.	1
Generally,	1
as	1
the	1
electrons	1
receive	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
trillions	1
of	1
waves,	1
they	1
absorb	1
either	1
the	1
long	1
or	1
the	1
medium	1
or	1
the	1
short,	1
and	1
they	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
wonderful	1
colour-scheme	1
of	1
nature.	1
In	1
some	1
cases	1
the	1
electrons	1
continue	1
to	1
radiate	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
sunlight	1
has	1
ceased	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
them.	1
We	1
get	1
from	1
them	1
"black"	1
or	1
invisible	1
light,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
take	1
photographs	1
by	1
it.	1
Other	1
bodies,	1
like	1
glass,	1
vibrate	1
in	1
unison	1
with	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
light-waves	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
stream	1
through.	1
Light	1
without	1
Heat	1
There	1
are	1
substances--"phosphorescent"	1
things	1
we	1
call	1
them--which	1
give	1
out	1
a	1
mysterious	1
cold	1
light	1
of	1
their	1
own.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
problems	1
of	1
science,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
profound	1
practical	1
interest.	1
If	1
we	1
could	1
produce	1
light	1
without	1
heat	1
our	1
"gas	1
bill"	1
would	1
shrink	1
amazingly.	1
So	1
much	1
energy	1
is	1
wasted	1
in	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
heat-waves	1
and	1
ultra-violet	1
waves	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
want,	1
that	1
90	1
per	1
cent.	1
or	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
used	1
in	1
illumination	1
is	1
wasted.	1
Would	1
that	1
the	1
glow-worm,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
dead	1
herring,	1
would	1
yield	1
us	1
its	1
secret!	1
Phosphorus	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
thing	1
we	1
know	1
as	1
yet	1
that	1
suits	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and--it	1
smells!	1
Indeed,	1
our	1
artificial	1
light	1
is	1
not	1
only	1
extravagant	1
in	1
cost,	1
but	1
often	1
poor	1
in	1
colour.	1
The	1
unwary	1
person	1
often	1
buys	1
a	1
garment	1
by	1
artificial	1
light,	1
and	1
is	1
disgusted	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
colour	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
wanted.	1
The	1
colour	1
disclosed	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
the	1
artificial	1
light.	1

"ultra-violet"	1

As	1

is	1
these	1
which	1

It	1

the	1

preparing	1

The	1

spreads	1
out	1
its	1

to	1
the	1

In	1
our	1
coal-measures,	1
the	1
mighty	1
dead	1
forests	1
of	1
long	1
ago,	1
are	1
vast	1
stores	1
of	1
sunlight	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
prodigally	1
using	1
up.	1
The	1
X-rays	1
are	1
the	1
extreme	1
end,	1
the	1
highest	1
octave,	1
of	1
the	1
series	1
of	1
waves.	1
Their	1
power	1
of	1
penetration	1
implies	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
excessively	1
minute,	1
but	1
even	1
these	1
have	1
not	1
held	1
their	1
secret	1
from	1
the	1
modern	1
physicist.	1
From	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
beautiful	1
experiments,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
pass	1
amongst	1
the	1

we	1

their	1

It	1

about	1
the	1

a	1
millimetre,	1
and	1
a	1
millimetre	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
1/25	1
of	1
an	1
inch!	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
recent	1
discoveries,	1
made	1
during	1
a	1
recent	1
eclipse	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
is	1
that	1
light	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
gravitation.	1
A	1
ray	1

its	1
straight	1
path	1
when	1
it	1
passes	1
near	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
Professor	1
Eddington	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
right	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
light	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1

Professor	1
Eddington	1
even	1
calculates	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
receives	1
160	1
tons	1
of	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
sun	1
every	1

ENERGY:	1
HOW	1
ALL	1
LIFE	1
DEPENDS	1
ON	1
IT	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
an	1
earlier	1
chapter,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fundamental	1
entities	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
matter.	1
A	1
second,	1
not	1
less	1
important,	1
is	1
called	1
energy.	1
Energy	1
is	1
indispensable	1
if	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
to	1
continue	1
to	1
exist,	1
since	1
all	1
phenomena,	1
including	1
life,	1
depend	1
on	1
it.	1
Just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
humanly	1
impossible	1
to	1
create	1
or	1
to	1
destroy	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
matter,	1
so	1
is	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
create	1
or	1
to	1
destroy	1
energy.	1
This	1
statement	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
readily	1
understood	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
considered	1
what	1
energy	1
is.	1
Energy,	1
like	1
matter,	1
is	1
indestructible,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
matter	1
exists	1
in	1
various	1
forms	1
so	1
does	1
energy.	1
And	1
we	1
may	1
add,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
negative	1
and	1
positive	1
particles	1
of	1
electricity	1
which	1
constitute	1
matter	1
really	1
are,	1
so	1
we	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
energy.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
energy	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
completely	1
mysterious	1
as	1
it	1
once	1
was.	1
It	1
is	1
another	1
of	1
nature's	1
mysteries	1
which	1
the	1
advance	1
of	1
modern	1
science	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
unveiled.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
during	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
century	1
that	1
energy	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
as	1
something	1
as	1
distinct	1
and	1
permanent	1
as	1
matter	1
itself.	1
Forms	1
of	1
Energy	1
The	1
existence	1
of	1
various	1
forms	1
of	1
energy	1
had	1
been	1
known,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
ages;	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
a	1
falling	1
stone,	1
the	1
energy	1
produced	1
by	1
burning	1
wood	1
or	1
coal	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
substance,	1
but	1
the	1
essential	1
_identity_	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
forms	1
of	1
energy	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
suspected.	1
The	1
conception	1
of	1
energy	1
as	1
something	1
which,	1
like	1
matter,	1
was	1
constant	1
in	1
amount,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
created	1
nor	1
destroyed,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
scientific	1
acquisitions	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
century.	1

It	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
to	1
enter	1
deeply	1
into	1
this	1
subject	1
here.	1
It	1
is	1
sufficient	1
if	1
we	1
briefly	1
outline	1
its	1
salient	1
aspects.	1
Energy	1
is	1
recognised	1
in	1
two	1
forms,	1
kinetic	1
and	1
potential.	1
The	1
form	1
of	1
energy	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
apparent	1
to	1
us	1
is	1
the	1
_energy	1
of	1
motion_;	1
for	1
example,	1
a	1
rolling	1
stone,	1
running	1
water,	1
a	1
falling	1
body,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
We	1
call	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
motion	1
_kinetic	1
energy_.	1
Potential	1
energy	1
is	1
the	1
energy	1
a	1
body	1
has	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
its	1
position--it	1
is	1
its	1
capacity,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
to	1
acquire	1
kinetic	1
energy,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
stone	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
cliff.	1
Energy	1
may	1
assume	1
different	1
forms;	1
one	1
kind	1
of	1
energy	1
may	1
be	1
converted	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly	1
into	1
some	1
other	1
form.	1
The	1
energy	1
of	1
burning	1
coal,	1
for	1
example,	1
is	1
converted	1
into	1
heat,	1
and	1
from	1
heat	1
energy	1
we	1
have	1
mechanical	1
energy,	1
such	1
as	1
that	1
manifested	1
by	1
the	1
steam-engine.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
can	1
transfer	1
energy	1
from	1
one	1
body	1
to	1
another.	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
waterfalls	1
of	1
Niagara,	1
for	1
instance,	1
which	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
huge	1
electric	1
power	1
stations.	1
What	1
Heat	1
is	1
An	1
important	1
fact	1
about	1
energy	1
is,	1
that	1
all	1
energy	1
_tends	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
heat	1
energy_.	1
The	1
impact	1
of	1
a	1
falling	1
stone	1
generates	1
heat;	1
a	1
waterfall	1
is	1
hotter	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
than	1
at	1
the	1
top--the	1
falling	1
particles	1
of	1
water,	1
on	1
striking	1
the	1
ground,	1
generate	1
heat;	1
and	1
most	1
chemical	1
changes	1
are	1
attended	1
by	1
heat	1
changes.	1
Energy	1
may	1
remain	1
latent	1
indefinitely	1
in	1
a	1
lump	1
of	1
wood,	1
but	1
in	1
combustion	1
it	1
is	1
liberated,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
heat	1
as	1
a	1
result.	1
The	1
atom	1
of	1
radium	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
radio-active	1
substance,	1
as	1
it	1
disintegrates,	1
generates	1
heat.	1
"Every	1
hour	1
radium	1
generates	1
sufficient	1
heat	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
weight	1
of	1
water,	1
from	1
the	1
freezing	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
boiling	1
point."	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
heat?	1
_Heat	1
is	1
molecular	1
motion._	1
The	1
molecules	1
of	1
every	1
substance,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
on	1
a	1
previous	1
page,	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
continual	1
motion,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
vigorous	1
the	1
motion	1
the	1
hotter	1
the	1
body.	1
As	1
wood	1
or	1
coal	1
burns,	1
the	1
invisible	1
molecules	1
of	1
these	1
substances	1
are	1
violently	1
agitated,	1
and	1
give	1
rise	1
to	1
ether	1
waves	1
which	1
our	1
senses	1
interpret	1
as	1
light	1
and	1
heat.	1
In	1
this	1
constant	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
molecules,	1
then,	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
manifestation	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
motion	1
and	1
of	1
heat.	1
That	1
energy	1
which	1
disappears	1
in	1
one	1
form	1
reappears	1
in	1
another	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
universally	1
true.	1
It	1
was	1
Joule	1
who,	1
by	1
churning	1
water,	1
first	1
showed	1
that	1
a	1
measurable	1
quantity	1
of	1
mechanical	1
energy	1
could	1
be	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
measurable	1
quantity	1
of	1
heat	1
energy.	1
By	1
causing	1
an	1
apparatus	1
to	1
stir	1
water	1
vigorously,	1
that	1
apparatus	1
being	1
driven	1
by	1
falling	1
weights	1
or	1
a	1
rotating	1
flywheel	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
mechanical	1
means,	1
the	1
water	1
became	1
heated.	1
A	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
mechanical	1
energy	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
up	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
heat	1
had	1
appeared.	1
The	1
relation	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
things	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
invariable.	1
Every	1
physical	1
change	1
in	1
nature	1
involves	1
a	1
transformation	1
of	1
energy,	1
but	1
the	1
total	1
quantity	1
of	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
remains	1
unaltered.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
doctrine	1
of	1
the	1
Conservation	1
of	1
Energy.	1
§	1
13	1
Substitutes	1
for	1
Coal	1
Consider	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
energy	1
which	1
is	1
used	1
in	1
modern	1
civilisation--coal.	1
The	1
great	1
forests	1
of	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
epoch	1
now	1
exists	1
as	1
beds	1
of	1
coal.	1
By	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
coal--a	1
chemical	1
transformation--the	1
heat	1
energy	1
is	1
produced	1
on	1
which	1
at	1
present	1
our	1
whole	1
civilisation	1
depends.	1
Whence	1
is	1
the	1
energy	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
coal	1
derived?	1
From	1
the	1
sun.	1
For	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
vast	1
vegetation	1
of	1
the	1
Carboniferous	1
era	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
transformed,	1
by	1
various	1
subtle	1
processes,	1
into	1
the	1
potential	1
energy	1
that	1
slumbers	1
in	1
those	1
immense	1
fossilized	1
forests.	1
The	1
exhaustion	1
of	1
our	1
coal	1
deposits	1
would	1
mean,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
our	1
knowledge	1
extends	1
at	1
present,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world's	1
civilisation.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
known	1
sources	1
of	1
energy,	1
it	1
is	1
true.	1
There	1
is	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
falling	1
water;	1
the	1
great	1
falls	1
of	1
Niagara	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
huge	1
electric	1
power	1
stations.	1
Perhaps,	1
also,	1
something	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
utilise	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
tides--another	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
moving	1
water.	1
And	1
attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
utilise	1
directly	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
sun's	1
rays.	1
But	1
all	1
these	1
sources	1
of	1
energy	1
are	1
small	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
coal.	1
A	1
suggestion	1
was	1
made	1
at	1
a	1
recent	1
British	1
Association	1
meeting	1
that	1
deep	1
borings	1
might	1
be	1
sunk	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
utilise	1
the	1
internal	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
very	1
practical	1
proposal.	1
By	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
effective	1
substitutes	1
for	1
coal	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
interior	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
atom,	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
energy	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
is	1
practically	1
illimitable.	1
If	1
the	1
immense	1
electrical	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
interior	1
of	1
the	1
atom	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
liberated	1
and	1
controlled,	1
then	1
our	1
steadily	1
decreasing	1
coal	1
supply	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
the	1
bugbear	1
it	1
now	1
is	1
to	1
all	1
thoughtful	1
men.	1
The	1
stored-up	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
coal-fields	1
can	1
be	1
used	1
up,	1
but	1
we	1
cannot	1
replace	1
it	1
or	1
create	1
fresh	1
supplies.	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
energy	1
cannot	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
become	1
_unavailable_.	1
Let	1
us	1
consider	1
what	1
this	1
important	1
fact	1
means.	1

Energy	1
may	1

Where	1
does	1
it	1
go?	1
since	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
indestructible	1
it	1
must	1
still	1
exist.	1
It	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
question	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
final	1
answer,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
in	1
this	1
OUTLINE,	1
where	1
an	1
advanced	1
knowledge	1
of	1
physics	1
is	1
not	1
assumed	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
reader,	1
to	1
go	1
fully	1
into	1
the	1
somewhat	1
difficult	1
theories	1
put	1
forward	1
by	1
physicists	1
and	1
chemists.	1
We	1
may	1
raise	1
the	1
temperature,	1
say,	1
of	1
iron,	1
until	1
it	1
is	1
white-hot.	1
If	1
we	1
stop	1
the	1
process	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
iron	1
will	1
gradually	1
settle	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
temperature	1
of	1
surrounding	1
bodies.	1
As	1
it	1
does	1
so,	1
where	1
does	1
its	1
previous	1
energy	1
go?	1
In	1
some	1
measure	1
it	1
may	1
pass	1
to	1
other	1
bodies	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
iron,	1
but	1
ultimately	1
the	1
heat	1
becomes	1
radiated	1
away	1
in	1
space	1
where	1
we	1
cannot	1
follow	1
it.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
vast	1
reservoir	1
of	1
_unavailable_	1
heat	1
energy	1
of	1
uniform	1
temperature.	1
It	1
is	1
sufficient	1
here	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
all	1
bodies	1
had	1
a	1
uniform	1
temperature	1
we	1
should	1
experience	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
heat,	1
because	1
heat	1
only	1
travels	1
from	1
one	1
body	1
to	1
another,	1
having	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
cooling	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
warming	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
bodies	1
acquire	1
the	1
same	1
temperature.	1
The	1
sum-total	1
of	1
the	1
heat	1
in	1
any	1
body	1
is	1
measured	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
kinetic	1
energy	1
of	1
its	1
moving	1
molecules.	1
There	1
must	1
come	1
a	1
time,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
see	1
at	1
present,	1
when,	1
even	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
heat	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
not	1
radiated	1
away	1
into	1
empty	1
infinite	1
space,	1
yet	1
a	1
uniform	1
temperature	1
will	1
prevail.	1
If	1
one	1
body	1
is	1
hotter	1
than	1
another	1
it	1
radiates	1
heat	1
to	1
that	1
body	1
until	1
both	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
temperature.	1
Each	1
body	1
may	1
still	1
possess	1
a	1
considerable	1
quantity	1
of	1
heat	1
energy,	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
absorbed,	1
but	1
that	1
energy,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
reactions	1
between	1
those	1
two	1
bodies	1
are	1
concerned,	1
_is	1
now	1
unavailable_.	1
The	1
same	1
principle	1
applies	1
whatever	1
number	1
of	1
bodies	1
we	1
consider.	1
Before	1
heat	1
energy	1
can	1
be	1
utilised	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
bodies	1
with	1
different	1
temperature.	1
If	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
were	1
at	1
some	1
uniform	1
temperature,	1
then,	1
although	1
it	1
might	1
possess	1
an	1
enormous	1
amount	1
of	1
heat	1
energy,	1
this	1
energy	1
would	1
be	1
unavailable.	1
What	1
a	1
Uniform	1
Temperature	1
would	1
mean	1
And	1
what	1
does	1
this	1
imply?	1
It	1
implies	1
a	1
great	1
deal:	1
for	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
became	1
unavailable,	1
the	1
universe,	1
as	1
it	1
now	1
is,	1
would	1
cease	1
to	1
be.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that,	1
by	1
the	1
constant	1
interchange	1
of	1
heat	1
radiations,	1
the	1
whole	1
universe	1
is	1
tending	1
to	1
some	1
uniform	1
temperature,	1
in	1
which	1
case,	1
although	1
all	1
molecular	1
motion	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
ceased,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
become	1
unavailable.	1
In	1
this	1
sense	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
running	1
down.	1

"BOILING"	1
A	1
KETTLE	1
ON	1
ICE	1
When	1
a	1
kettle	1
containing	1
liquid	1
air	1
is	1
placed	1
on	1
ice	1
it	1
"boils"	1
because	1
the	1
ice	1
is	1
intensely	1
hot	1
_when	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
low	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
liquid	1
air_.]	1
If	1
all	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
a	1
substance	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
standstill,	1
that	1
substance	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
absolute	1
zero	1
of	1
temperature.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
colder.	1
The	1
temperature	1
at	1
which	1
all	1
molecular	1
motions	1
would	1
cease	1
is	1
known:	1
it	1
is	1
-273°	1
C.	1
No	1
body	1
could	1
possibly	1
attain	1
a	1
lower	1
temperature	1
than	1
this:	1
a	1
lower	1
temperature	1
could	1
not	1
exist.	1
Unless	1
there	1
exists	1
in	1
nature	1
some	1
process,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
nothing	1
at	1
present,	1
whereby	1
energy	1
is	1
renewed,	1
our	1
solar	1
system	1
must	1
one	1
day	1
sink	1
to	1
this	1
absolute	1
zero	1
of	1
temperature.	1
The	1
sun,	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
universe	1
is	1
steadily	1
radiating	1
heat,	1
and	1
this	1
radiation	1
cannot	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
ever,	1
because	1
heat	1
continually	1
tends	1
to	1
diffuse	1
and	1
to	1
equalise	1
temperatures.	1
But	1
we	1
can	1
see,	1
theoretically,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
evading	1
this	1
law.	1
If	1
the	1
chaotic	1
molecular	1
motions	1
which	1
constitute	1
heat	1
could	1
be	1
_regulated_,	1
then	1
the	1
heat	1
energy	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
could	1
be	1
utilised	1
directly.	1
Some	1
authorities	1
think	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
processes	1
which	1
go	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
living	1
body	1
do	1
not	1
involve	1
any	1
waste	1
energy,	1
that	1
the	1
chemical	1
energy	1
of	1
food	1
is	1
transformed	1
directly	1
into	1
work	1
without	1
any	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
dissipated	1
as	1
useless	1
heat	1
energy.	1
It	1
may	1
be,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
man	1
will	1
finally	1
discover	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
law	1
that,	1
while	1
energy	1
cannot	1
be	1
destroyed,	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
become	1
unavailable.	1
The	1
primary	1
reservoir	1
of	1
energy	1
is	1
the	1
atom;	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
atom,	1
the	1
atom	1
of	1
elements	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
the	1
stars,	1
the	1
earth,	1
from	1
which	1
nature	1
draws	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
supply	1
of	1
energy.	1
Shall	1
we	1
ever	1
discover	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
replenish	1
the	1
dwindling	1
resources	1
of	1
energy,	1
or	1
find	1
out	1
how	1
we	1
can	1
call	1
into	1
being	1
the	1
at	1
present	1
unavailable	1
energy	1
which	1
is	1
stored	1
up	1
in	1
uniform	1
temperature?	1
It	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
our	1
successors	1
would	1
witness	1
an	1
interesting	1
race,	1
between	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
science	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
depletion	1
of	1
natural	1
resources	1
upon	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
natural	1
rate	1
of	1
flow	1
of	1
energy	1
from	1
its	1
primary	1
atomic	1
reservoirs	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1

of	1

temperature,	1
allows	1

to	1
proceed	1

a	1

pace	1
sternly	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
inexorable	1

which	1

_Matter	1
and	1
Energy_,	1
by	1
Professor	1
Soddy.	1
It	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
energy	1
is	1
an	1
actual	1
entity	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
matter,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
created	1
or	1
destroyed.	1
Matter	1
and	1
ether	1
are	1
receptacles	1
or	1
vehicles	1
of	1
energy.	1
As	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
what	1
these	1
entities	1
really	1
are	1
in	1
themselves	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
all	1
forms	1
of	1
energy	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
fundamental	1
way	1
aspects	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
primary	1
entity	1
which	1
constitutes	1
matter:	1
how	1
all	1
matter	1
is	1
constituted	1
of	1
particles	1
of	1
electricity	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
seen.	1
The	1
question	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
await	1
an	1
answer	1
is:	1
What	1
is	1
electricity?	1

that	1
the	1
electron	1
is	1
a	1
tiny	1
whirlpool,	1
or	1
"vortex,"	1
in	1
ether;	1
and,	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
vortex	1
may	1
turn	1
in	1
either	1
of	1
two	1
opposite	1
ways,	1
we	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
possibility	1
of	1
explaining	1
positive	1
and	1
negative	1
electricity.	1
But	1
the	1
difficulties	1
have	1
proved	1
very	1
serious,	1
and	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
electron	1
is	1
unknown.	1
A	1
recent	1
view	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
"a	1
ring	1
of	1
negative	1
electricity	1
rotating	1
about	1
its	1
axis	1
at	1
a	1
high	1
speed,"	1
though	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
carry	1
us	1
very	1
far.	1
The	1
unit	1
of	1
positive	1
electricity	1
is	1
even	1
less	1
known.	1
We	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
general	1
lines	1
on	1
which	1
thought	1
is	1
moving	1
toward	1
the	1
final	1
unification.	1
We	1
say	1
"unification,"	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
grave	1
error	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
ether	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
possible	1
basis	1
for	1
such	1
unity,	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
an	1
essential	1
part	1
of	1
one's	1
philosophy	1
of	1
the	1
universe.	1
Ether	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
imagined	1
entity	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
ascribed	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
properties,	1
and	1
which	1
seemed	1
then	1
to	1
promise	1
considerable	1
aid.	1
It	1
was	1
conceived	1
as	1
an	1
elastic	1
solid	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
density,	1
stretching	1
from	1
end	1
to	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
transmitting	1
waves	1
from	1
star	1
to	1
star	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
186,000	1
miles	1
a	1
second;	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
solid	1
matter	1
passed	1
through	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
exist.	1
Some	1
years	1
ago	1
a	1
delicate	1
experiment	1
was	1
tried	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
detecting	1
the	1
ether.	1
Since	1
the	1
earth,	1
in	1
travelling	1
round	1
the	1
sun,	1
must	1
move	1
through	1
the	1
ether	1
if	1
the	1
ether	1
exists,	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
ether	1
flowing	1
through	1
every	1
laboratory;	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
a	1
ship	1
through	1
a	1
still	1
atmosphere	1
will	1
make	1
"a	1
wind."	1
In	1
1887	1
Michelson	1
and	1
Morley	1
tried	1
to	1
detect	1
this.	1
Theoretically,	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
ought	1
to	1
travel	1
at	1
a	1
different	1
rate	1
from	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
against	1
the	1
stream	1
or	1
across	1
it.	1
They	1
found	1
no	1
difference,	1
and	1
scores	1
of	1
other	1
experiments	1
have	1
failed.	1
This	1
does	1
not	1
prove	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
ether,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
our	1
instruments	1
would	1
appear	1
to	1
shrink	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
alteration	1
of	1
the	1
light;	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
remains	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
ether.	1
J.	1
H.	1
Jeans	1
says	1
that	1
"nature	1
acts	1
as	1
if	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
existed."	1
Even	1
the	1
phenomena	1
of	1
light	1
and	1
magnetism,	1
he	1
says,	1
do	1
not	1
imply	1
ether;	1
and	1
he	1
thinks	1
that	1
the	1
hypothesis	1
may	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
The	1
primary	1
reason,	1
of	1
course,	1
for	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
ether	1
is	1
that,	1
as	1
Einstein	1
has	1
shown,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
detecting	1
its	1
existence.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
ether,	1
then,	1
since	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
moving	1
through	1
it,	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
detecting	1
this	1
motion.	1
The	1
experiment	1
has	1
been	1
tried,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
but,	1
although	1
the	1
method	1
used	1
was	1
very	1
sensitive,	1
no	1
motion	1
was	1
discovered.	1
It	1
is	1
Einstein	1
who,	1
by	1
revolutionising	1
our	1
conceptions	1
of	1
space	1
and	1
time,	1
showed	1
that	1
no	1
such	1
motion	1
ever	1
could	1
be	1
discovered,	1
whatever	1
means	1
were	1
employed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
usual	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
ether	1
must	1
be	1
abandoned.	1
We	1
shall	1
explain	1
this	1
theory	1
more	1
fully	1
in	1
a	1
later	1
section.	1

§	1
16	1
Until	1
comparatively	1
recent	1
times,	1
until,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
full	1
dawn	1
of	1
modern	1
science,	1
the	1
tides	1
ranked	1
amongst	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
nature's	1
mysteries.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
what	1
agency	1
could	1
be	1
invoked	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
mysteriously	1
regular	1
flux	1
and	1
reflux	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
ocean?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
surprising	1
that	1
that	1
steady,	1
rhythmical	1
rise	1
and	1
fall	1
suggested	1
to	1
some	1
imaginative	1
minds	1
the	1
breathing	1
of	1
a	1
mighty	1
animal.	1
And	1
even	1
when	1
man	1
first	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
this	1
regular	1
movement	1
was	1
somehow	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
moon,	1
was	1
he	1
much	1
nearer	1
an	1
explanation?	1
What	1
bond	1
could	1
exist	1
between	1
the	1
movements	1
of	1
that	1
distant	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
diurnal	1
variation	1
of	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
earth?	1
It	1
is	1
reported	1
that	1
an	1
ancient	1
astronomer,	1
despairing	1
of	1
ever	1
resolving	1
the	1
mystery,	1
drowned	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
Earth	1
Pulled	1
by	1
the	1
Moon	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
Newton's	1
mighty	1
theory	1
of	1
gravitation	1
that	1
it	1
furnished	1
an	1
explanation	1
even	1
of	1
this	1
age-old	1
mystery.	1
We	1
can	1
see,	1
in	1
broad	1
outlines	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
that	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
universal	1
attraction	1
can	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
this	1
case.	1
For	1
the	1
moon,	1
Newton	1
taught	1
us,	1
pulls	1
every	1
particle	1
of	1
matter	1
throughout	1
the	1
earth.	1
If	1
we	1
imagine	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface	1
which	1
comprises	1
the	1
Pacific	1
Ocean,	1
for	1
instance,	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
moon,	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
moon's	1
pull,	1
_acting	1
on	1
the	1
loose	1
and	1
mobile	1
water_,	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
heap	1
it	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mound.	1
The	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
pulled	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
but	1
the	1
water	1
is	1
more	1
free	1
to	1
obey	1
this	1
pull	1
than	1
is	1
the	1
solid	1
earth,	1
although	1
small	1
tides	1
are	1
also	1
caused	1
in	1
the	1
earth's	1
solid	1
crust.	1
It	1
can	1
be	1
shown	1
also	1
that	1
a	1
corresponding	1
hump	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
be	1
produced	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
owing,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
to	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
being	1
more	1
loosely	1
connected,	1
to	1
lag	1
behind	1
the	1
solid	1
earth.	1
If	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface	1
were	1
entirely	1
fluid	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
would	1
give	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
these	1
two	1
humps	1
were	1
continually	1
travelling	1
round	1
the	1
world,	1
once	1
every	1
day.	1
At	1
any	1
given	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
earth's	1
surface,	1
therefore,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
two	1
humps	1
daily,	1
i.e.	1
two	1
periods	1
of	1
high	1
water.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
simplest	1
possible	1
outline	1
of	1
the	1
gravitational	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
tides.	1
[Illustration:	1
THE	1
CAUSE	1
OF	1
TIDES	1
The	1
tides	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
are	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
pull	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
and,	1
in	1
lesser	1
degree,	1
of	1
the	1
sun.	1
The	1
whole	1
earth	1
is	1
pulled	1
by	1
the	1
moon,	1
but	1
the	1
loose	1
and	1

than	1

although	1
small	1
tides	1
are	1
also	1
caused	1
in	1
the	1
earth's	1
solid	1

The	1
effect	1
which	1
the	1
tides	1
have	1
on	1
slowing	1
down	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1

An	1

smooth	1

to	1

The	1
wall-like	1
formation	1
of	1
these	1
tidal	1
waves	1
(see	1
next	1
page	1
also)	1
will	1
be	1
noticed.	1
The	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
downward	1
current	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
heads	1
the	1
sea-water	1
back,	1
and	1
thus	1
helps	1
to	1
exaggerate	1
the	1
advancing	1
slope	1
of	1
the	1
wave.	1
The	1
exceptional	1
spring	1

are	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
combined	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1

A	1
BIG	1
SPRING	1
TIDE,	1
THE	1
AEGIR	1
ON	1
THE	1
TRENT]	1
The	1
actually	1
observed	1
phenomena	1
are	1
vastly	1
more	1
complicated,	1
and	1
the	1
complete	1
theory	1
bears	1
very	1
little	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
simple	1
form	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
outlined.	1
Everyone	1
who	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
a	1
port	1
knows,	1
for	1
instance,	1
that	1
high	1
water	1
seldom	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
moon	1
crosses	1
the	1
meridian.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
several	1
hours	1
early	1
or	1
late.	1
High	1
water	1
at	1
London	1
Bridge,	1
for	1
instance,	1
occurs	1
about	1
one	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
hours	1
after	1
the	1
moon	1
has	1
passed	1
the	1
meridian,	1
while	1
at	1
Dublin	1
high	1
water	1
occurs	1
about	1
one	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
hours	1
before	1
the	1
moon	1
crosses	1
the	1
meridian.	1
The	1
actually	1
observed	1
phenomena,	1
then,	1
are	1
far	1
from	1
simple;	1
they	1
have,	1
nevertheless,	1
been	1
very	1
completely	1
worked	1
out,	1
and	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
high	1
water	1
for	1
every	1
port	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
now	1
be	1
prophesied	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
ahead.	1
The	1
Action	1
of	1
Sun	1
and	1
Moon	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
beyond	1
our	1
scope	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
complete	1
theory,	1
but	1
we	1
may	1
mention	1
one	1
obvious	1
factor	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
account.	1
Since	1
the	1
moon,	1
by	1
its	1
gravitational	1
attraction,	1
produces	1
tides,	1
we	1
should	1
expect	1
that	1
the	1
sun,	1
whose	1
gravitational	1
attraction	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
stronger,	1
should	1
also	1
produce	1
tides	1
and,	1
we	1
would	1
suppose	1
at	1
first	1
sight,	1
more	1
powerful	1
tides	1
than	1
the	1
moon.	1
But	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
produces	1
tides,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
true	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
powerful	1
than	1
those	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
sun's	1
tide-producing	1
power	1
is,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
_distance_	1
plays	1
an	1
enormous	1
rôin	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
tides.	1
The	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
26,000,000	1
times	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
moon;	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
it	1
is	1
386	1
times	1
as	1
far	1
off	1
as	1
the	1
moon.	1
This	1
greater	1
distance	1
more	1
than	1
counterbalances	1
its	1
greater	1
mass,	1
and	1
the	1
result,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
said,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
twice	1
as	1
powerful.	1
Sometimes	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
act	1
together,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
spring	1
tides;	1
sometimes	1
they	1
act	1
against	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
neap	1
tides.	1
These	1
effects	1
are	1
further	1
complicated	1
by	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
other	1
factors,	1
and	1
the	1
tides,	1
at	1
various	1
places,	1
vary	1
enormously.	1
Thus	1
at	1
St.	1
Helena	1
the	1
sea	1
rises	1
and	1
falls	1
about	1
three	1
feet,	1
whereas	1
in	1
the	1
Bay	1
of	1
Fundy	1
it	1
rises	1
and	1
falls	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
feet.	1
But	1
here,	1
again,	1
the	1
reasons	1
are	1
complicated.	1
§	1

Origin	1
of	1
the	1
Moon	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
tides	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
vastly	1
greater	1
interest	1
and	1
importance	1
than	1
the	1
theory	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
been	1
discussing.	1
In	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Sir	1
George	1
H.	1
Darwin,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Charles	1
Darwin,	1
the	1
tides	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
throw	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
evolution	1
of	1
our	1
solar	1
system.	1
In	1
particular,	1
they	1
have	1
illustrated	1
the	1
origin	1
and	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
formed	1
by	1
our	1
earth	1
and	1
moon.	1
It	1
is	1
quite	1
certain	1
that,	1
long	1
ages	1
ago,	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
rotating	1
immensely	1
faster	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
now,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
so	1
near	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
actually	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
the	1
earth.	1
In	1
that	1
remote	1
age	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
just	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
separating	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
of	1
being	1
thrown	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
earth.	1
Earth	1
and	1
moon	1
were	1
once	1
one	1
body,	1
but	1
the	1
high	1
rate	1
of	1
rotation	1
caused	1
this	1
body	1
to	1
split	1
up	1
into	1
two	1
pieces;	1
one	1
piece	1
became	1
the	1
earth	1
we	1
now	1
know,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
became	1
the	1
moon.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
conclusion	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
led	1
by	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
tides.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
let	1
us	1
consider	1
the	1
energy	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
tides.	1
We	1
see	1
evidences	1
of	1
this	1
energy	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
word's	1
coastlines.	1
Estuaries	1
are	1
scooped	1
out,	1
great	1
rocks	1
are	1
gradually	1
reduced	1
to	1
rubble,	1
innumerable	1
tons	1
of	1
matter	1
are	1
continually	1
being	1
set	1
in	1
movement.	1
Whence	1
is	1
this	1
energy	1
derived?	1
Energy,	1
like	1
matter,	1
cannot	1
be	1
created	1
from	1
nothing;	1
what,	1
then,	1
is	1
the	1
source	1
which	1
makes	1
this	1
colossal	1
expenditure	1
possible.	1
The	1
Earth	1
Slowing	1
down	1
The	1
answer	1
is	1
simple,	1
but	1
startling.	1
_The	1
source	1
of	1
tidal	1
energy	1
is	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth._	1
The	1
massive	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
turning	1
every	1
twenty-four	1
hours	1
on	1
its	1
axis,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
gigantic	1
flywheel.	1
In	1
virtue	1
of	1
its	1
rotation	1
it	1
possesses	1
an	1
enormous	1
store	1
of	1
energy.	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
heaviest	1
and	1
swiftest	1
flywheel,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
doing	1
work,	1
or	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
working	1
against	1
the	1
friction	1
of	1
its	1
bearings,	1
cannot	1
dispense	1
energy	1
for	1
ever.	1
It	1
must,	1
gradually,	1
slow	1
down.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
reasoning.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
rotation	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
supplies	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
tides,	1
and,	1
as	1
a	1
consequence,	1
the	1
tides	1
must	1
be	1
slowing	1
down	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
tides	1
act	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
brake	1
on	1
the	1
earth's	1
rotation.	1
These	1
masses	1
of	1
water,	1
_held	1
back	1
by	1
the	1
moon_,	1
exert	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
dragging	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
rotating	1
earth.	1
Doubtless	1
this	1
effect,	1
measured	1
by	1
our	1
ordinary	1
standards,	1
is	1
very	1
small;	1
it	1
is,	1
however,	1
continuous,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
millions	1
of	1
years	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
astronomy,	1
this	1
small	1
but	1
constant	1
effect	1
may	1
produce	1
very	1
considerable	1
results.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
effect	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
necessary	1
mathematical	1
consequence	1
of	1
tidal	1
action.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
moon's	1
action	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
which	1
produces	1
the	1
tides,	1
but	1
they	1
also	1
react	1
on	1
the	1
moon.	1
The	1
tides	1
are	1
slowing	1
down	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
also	1
driving	1
the	1
moon	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
away.	1
This	1
result,	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
does	1
not	1
permit	1
of	1
doubt,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
an	1
indubitable	1
dynamical	1
principle,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
clear	1
without	1
a	1
mathematical	1
discussion.	1
Some	1
interesting	1
consequences	1
follow.	1
Since	1
the	1
earth	1
is	1
slowing	1
down,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
once	1
rotating	1
faster.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
period,	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
comprised	1
only	1
twenty	1
hours.	1
Going	1
farther	1
back	1
still	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
ten	1
hours,	1
until,	1
inconceivable	1
ages	1
ago,	1
the	1
earth	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
rotating	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
in	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
from	1
three	1
to	1
four	1
hours.	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
let	1
us	1
stop	1
and	1
inquire	1
what	1
was	1
happening	1
to	1
the	1
moon.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
at	1
present	1
the	1
moon	1
is	1
getting	1
farther	1
and	1
farther	1
away.	1
It	1
follows,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
shorter	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
nearer.	1
As	1
we	1
go	1
farther	1
back	1
in	1
time	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
moon	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer	1
to	1
an	1
earth	1
rotating	1
faster	1
and	1
faster.	1
When	1
we	1
reach	1
the	1
period	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
the	1
period	1
when	1
the	1
earth	1
completed	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hours,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
so	1
near	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
grazing	1
the	1
earth.	1
This	1
fact	1
is	1
very	1
remarkable.	1
Everybody	1
knows	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
_critical	1
velocity_	1
for	1
a	1
rotating	1
flywheel,	1
a	1
velocity	1
beyond	1
which	1
the	1
flywheel	1
would	1
fly	1
into	1
pieces	1
because	1
the	1
centrifugal	1
force	1
developed	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
cohesion	1
of	1
the	1
molecules	1
of	1
the	1
flywheel.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
likened	1
our	1
earth	1
to	1
a	1
flywheel,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
traced	1
its	1
history	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
rotating	1
with	1
immense	1
velocity.	1
We	1
have	1
also	1
seen	1
that,	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
barely	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
is	1
irresistible.	1
In	1
an	1
age	1
more	1
remote	1
the	1
earth	1
_did_	1
fly	1
in	1
pieces,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
pieces	1
is	1
the	1
moon.	1
Such,	1
in	1
brief	1
outline,	1
is	1
the	1
tidal	1
theory	1
of	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
earth-moon	1
system.	1
The	1
Day	1
Becoming	1
Longer	1
At	1
the	1
beginning,	1
when	1
the	1
moon	1
split	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
it	1
obviously	1
must	1
have	1
shared	1
the	1
earth's	1
rotation.	1
It	1
flew	1
round	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
rotated,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
month	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
of	1
equal	1
length.	1
As	1
the	1
moon	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
farther	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
the	1
month,	1
because	1
the	1
moon	1
took	1
longer	1
to	1
rotate	1
round	1
the	1
earth,	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
correspondingly	1
longer.	1
The	1
day	1
also	1
became	1
longer,	1
because	1
the	1
earth	1
was	1
slowing	1
down,	1
taking	1
longer	1
to	1
rotate	1
on	1
its	1
axis,	1
but	1
the	1
month	1
increased	1
at	1
a	1
greater	1
rate	1
than	1
the	1
day.	1
Presently	1
the	1
month	1
became	1
equal	1
to	1
two	1
days,	1
then	1
to	1
three,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
calculated	1
that	1
this	1
process	1
went	1
on	1
until	1
there	1
were	1
twenty-nine	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
month.	1
After	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
month	1
began	1
to	1
decrease	1
until	1
it	1
reached	1
its	1
present	1
value	1
or	1
magnitude,	1
and	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
decrease	1
until	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
month	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
are	1
equal.	1
In	1
that	1
age	1
the	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
rotating	1
very	1
slowly.	1
The	1
braking	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
tides	1
will	1
cause	1
the	1
earth	1
always	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
same	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
moon;	1
it	1
will	1
rotate	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
moon	1
turns	1
round	1
the	1
earth.	1
If	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
moon	1
were	1
involved	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
affairs	1
would	1
be	1
final.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
tides	1
to	1
be	1
considered.	1
The	1
moon	1
makes	1
the	1
day	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
month,	1
but	1
the	1
sun	1
has	1
a	1
tendency,	1
by	1
still	1
further	1
slowing	1
down	1
the	1
earth's	1
rotation	1
on	1
its	1
axis,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
day	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
year.	1
It	1
would	1
do	1
this,	1
of	1
course,	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
earth	1
take	1
as	1
long	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
its	1
axis	1
as	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
sun.	1
It	1
cannot	1
succeed	1
in	1
this,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
succeed	1
in	1
making	1
the	1
day	1
rather	1
longer	1
than	1
the	1
month.	1
Surprising	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
we	1
already	1
have	1
an	1
illustration	1
of	1
this	1
possibility	1
in	1
the	1
satellites	1
of	1
Mars.	1
The	1
Martian	1
day	1
is	1
about	1
one	1
half-hour	1
longer	1
than	1
ours,	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
minute	1
satellites	1
of	1
Mars	1
were	1
discovered	1
it	1
was	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
inner	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
revolved	1
round	1
Mars	1
in	1
about	1
seven	1
hours	1
forty	1
minutes.	1
In	1
one	1
Martian	1
day,	1
therefore,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
moons	1
of	1
Mars	1
makes	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
complete	1
revolutions	1
round	1
that	1
planet,	1
so	1
that,	1
to	1
an	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
Mars,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
months	1
in	1
a	1
day.	1
